1. **总台央视记者：据报道，28日，俄乌代表团在白乌边境城市戈梅利举行谈判。中方此前一直表示希望双方通过和平谈判寻求政治解决乌克兰问题，对当前谈判形势有何评论？**

   CCTV: It is reported that the Russian and Ukrainian delegations held negotiations in the Belarusian city of Gomel at the Belarus-Ukraine border on February 28. China has been saying that it hopes the two sides can seek a political settlement to the Ukraine issue through peaceful negotiations. Do you have any comment on the current negotiation situation?

   **汪文斌：中方一直支持和鼓励一切有利于和平解决乌克兰危机的外交努力，欢迎俄乌双方启动和平谈判。我们注意到，双方商定近期将举行新一轮谈判。希望双方继续保持对话谈判进程，寻求照顾双方合理安全关切、实现欧洲共同安全、有利于欧洲长治久安的政治解决之道。**

   Wang Wenbin: China always supports and encourages all diplomatic efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis and welcomes the launch of the peaceful negotiations by Russia and Ukraine. We have noted that the two sides have agreed to conduct a new round of negotiations shortly. We hope they can keep up the dialogue and negotiation process to seek a political settlement that accommodates both sides’ legitimate security concerns, achieves common security in Europe and promotes Europe’s lasting peace and stability.

2. **法新社记者：国际奥委会呼吁对俄罗斯和白俄罗斯运动员实施国际禁赛。如果国际残奥委会本周也宣布类似措施，俄罗斯运动员还能参加北京冬残奥会吗？**

   AFP: The IOC called for an international event ban for athletes from Russia and Belarus. If the International Paralympic Committee announced similar measures this week, will Russian athletes still compete in the Paralympic Winter Games?

   **汪文斌：这个问题请你向北京冬奥组委询问。**

   Wang Wenbin: Please direct your question to the Beijing Organising Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (BOCOG).

3. **《澳门月刊》记者：据报道，今天美国总统拜登授意派遣跨党派访问团访问台湾，由美军前参谋长联席会议主席马伦带领。蔡英文将于3月2日上午在台北接见该访问团。中方对此有何评论？**

   Macao Monthly: According to reports, US President Biden today decided to send a bipartisan delegation led by Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to visit Taiwan. Tsai Ing-wen is set to receive the delegation in Taipei on the morning of March 2. Do you have any comment?

   **汪文斌：中国人民捍卫国家主权和领土完整的决心和意志坚定不移。美方派任何人展示所谓对台支持都是徒劳的。中方敦促美方恪守一个中国原则和中美三个联合公报规定，停止任何形式的美台官方往来，慎重处理涉台问题，以免进一步严重损害中美关系大局和台海和平稳定。**

   Wang Wenbin: The Chinese people are firmly determined and resolved to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The attempt by the US to show support to Taiwan will be in vain, no matter who the US sends. China urges the US to abide by the one-China principle and stipulations in the three China-US joint communiqués, stop all forms of official interactions with Taiwan, and handle Taiwan-related issues in a prudent manner, lest it should further undermine the larger interests of China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.

4. **深圳卫视记者：近日，美国海军“约翰逊”号导弹驱逐舰通过台湾海峡，并对此进行公开炒作。请问发言人对此有何评论？**

   Shenzhen TV: The US guided-missile destroyer USS Ralph Johnson recently sailed through the Taiwan Strait and hyped it up. What is your comment on this?

   **汪文斌：我注意到，中国人民解放军东部战区新闻发言人已就此发表谈话。**

   Wang Wenbin: I noticed that spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command has released a written statement on this.

   **美方炒作美舰过航台湾海峡，不知其意欲何为？**

   What is the true intention of the US hyping of the USS’ passage through the Taiwan Strait?

   **如果美方想要借此给“台独”分子撑腰打气的话，我们要告诉美方，这只会加速“台独”势力的覆灭，美方也将为其冒险行径付出沉重代价。**

   If the US wants to embolden the “Taiwan independence” forces in this way, then we have this to say to the US: such move will only accelerate the demise of the “Taiwan independence” forces. The US will also pay a heavy price for its adventurist act.

   **如果美方试图以此向中方恫吓施压的话，我们要正告美方，在14亿中国人民组成的钢铁长城面前，所谓军力威慑不过是一堆废铁。**

   If the US tries to intimidate and pressure China in this way, then we have this stern warning: the so-called military deterrence will be reduced to scrap iron when facing the steely great wall of the 1.4 billion Chinese people.

   **美舰过航台湾海峡这套把戏，还是留给那些迷信霸权的人看吧。**

   The trick of sending vessels to sail through the Taiwan Strait should be better saved to entertain those obsessed with hegemony.

5. **湖北广播电视台记者：昨天，国务院新闻办公室发表《2021年美国侵犯人权报告》，揭露美国侵犯人权的真相。发言人对此有何评论？**

   Hubei Media Group: Yesterday, the State Council Information Office (SCIO) issued the Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States in 2021, which revealed the truth about the US violation of human rights. What is your comment?

   **汪文斌：我注意到中国国务院新闻办公室昨天发表了《2021年美国侵犯人权报告》。**

   Wang Wenbin: I noted the Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States in 2021 issued by the SCIO yesterday.

   **报告以大量事实和翔实数据说明，美国人权状况进一步恶化。作为全球医疗系统最发达的国家，美国累计新冠肺炎确诊病例和累计死亡人数却均居世界之首，去年人均预期寿命减少1.13岁，是自二战以来的最大降幅。美国社会治安形势恶化，全年共发生693起大规模枪击事件，比2020年增长10.1%，枪击事件导致超过4.4万人丧生。美国有49个州提出超过420项限制选民投票的法案，只有7%的美国年轻人认为美国民主制度尚属“健康”，公众对政府的信任度接近1958年以来历史低点。美国内针对少数族裔特别是亚裔的歧视攻击愈演愈烈，纽约市针对亚裔的仇恨犯罪比2020年猛增361%。美国暴力执法让移民难民的处境更加艰难。2021财年，美国在南部边境拘留了170多万移民，其中包括4.5万名儿童。暴力执法夺走557人生命，比上一个财年增长了一倍多。**

   The report showed that human rights conditions in the US further worsened supported by substantial facts and solid figures. With the most advanced medical system in the world, the US has logged the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Average life expectancy fell by 1.13 years last year, the biggest drop since the Second World War. Public security situation in the US deteriorated. There were 693 mass shootings in 2021, up 10.1 percent from 2020. More than 44,000 people were killed in gun violence. More than 420 bills with provisions that restrict voting access have been introduced in 49 US states. Only 7 percent of young Americans view the country as a “healthy democracy”, while public trust in the government has fallen to almost historical low since 1958. Attacks driven by discrimination targeted at racial minorities, especially Asian Americans, are getting more rampant. Hate crimes against Asians in the New York City jumped 361 percent from 2020. Violent law enforcement in the US makes life more difficult for migrants and refugees. In fiscal year 2021, the US detained more than 1.7 million migrants at its southern border, including 45,000 children. Violent law enforcement claimed 557 lives, which more than doubled the figure of the previous fiscal year.

   **种种人权悲剧不仅在美国国内上演，全球多地也因为美国霸权主义、单边主义、干涉主义行径而发生新的人道灾难。据统计，美国近20年发动的所谓“反恐”战争已经夺去超过92.9万人的生命。美国在阿富汗20年的军事行动，累计造成包括3万多名平民在内的17.4万人死亡，受伤人数超过6万。美军仓皇撤离喀布尔之后，美国立即将阿富汗央行70亿美元外汇储备冻结，日前还将其非法瓜分，致使阿富汗经济处于崩溃的边缘，人民生活雪上加霜。**

   A myriad of human rights tragedies are not only happening within the US borders. US hegemony, unilateralism and interventionism have led to new humanitarian disasters in many places all over the world. According to statistics, the so-called anti-terrorism war launched by the US in the past 20 years or so has claimed the lives of more than 929,000 people. The 20-year US military operations in Afghanistan have killed 174,000 people, including more than 30,000 civilians, and injured more than 60,000 people. Immediately after the troops’ hasty withdrawal from Kabul, the US froze seven billion dollars of Afghan central bank’s foreign reserve, and even split it illegally not long ago. Such practice has pushed the Afghan economy to the brink of collapse, and made people’s livelihood worse off.

   **美国在人权领域的双重标准更是举世闻名。美国一方面经常毫无依据地指责别国任意拘押、强迫劳动，另一方面却对本国监狱里司空见惯的酷刑虐待、“现代奴隶制”问题绝口不提。包括关塔那摩监狱在内的美国在全球各地的“黑狱”，未经审判就将人任意拘押并施以酷刑，这些都已成为美国践踏法治、侵犯人权的象征。**

   The US double standard on human rights issues is known around the world. On the one hand, the US groundlessly accuses others of arbitrary detention and forced labor, and on the other, it looks away from torture, abuse and modern slavery that are rife in US prisons. US “black sites” across the world including the Guantanamo Bay prison arbitrarily detain and torture people without prosecution, which have become a classic symbol for US’ affront to the rule of law and violation of human rights.

   **美国人权状况劣迹斑斑，却自称“人权卫士”，充当“人权判官”，大搞“人权外交”，这充分暴露了美方在人权问题上的虚伪性和双重标准。美方应该正视并反省自身存在的人权问题，彻底摒弃将人权政治化的行径，真正为改善美国人民的人权做些实事，不要再去伤害别国人民的人权。**

   With a deplorable human rights record, the US is calling itself a “human rights defender”, acting as a “human rights judge” and practicing “human rights diplomacy”. This fully reveals the US’ hypocrisy and double standard on human rights issues. The US should face up to and reflect on its own human rights problems, give up politicizing human rights, do something concrete to promote Americans’ human rights and stop undermining human rights in other countries.

6. **总台央视记者：我们注意到，昨天，王毅国务委员兼外长以视频方式出席联合国人权理事会第49届会议高级别会议，并发表致辞。你能否进一步介绍中方在保护和促进人权方面的有关主张？**

   CCTV: We noted that yesterday State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the high-level segment of the 49th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council via video link and delivered an address. Can you share more with us on China’s propositions on protecting and promoting human rights?

   **汪文斌：2月28日，王毅国务委员兼外长在北京以视频方式出席联合国人权理事会第49届会议高级别会议，并发表题为《坚持公平正义 推动全球人权事业健康发展》的致辞。**

   Wang Wenbin: On February 28, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the high-level segment of the 49th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council via video link in Beijing and delivered an address titled “Upholding Equity and Justice to Promote Sound Development of the Global Human Rights Cause”.

   **王毅国务委员在会上提出了中方促进和保护人权的四点主张：一是做保护人权的真正践行者。人权是历史的、具体的、现实的，人权事业发展必须立足本国国情和人民需求，协调增进全体人民的经济、政治、社会、文化、环境权利，促进和实现人的全面发展。二是做人民利益的忠实守护者。人民过上幸福生活是最大的人权。一国人权状况好不好，根本上要看人民对美好生活的向往是否得到满足，人民的所需所急所盼是否得到解决，人民的获得感、幸福感、安全感是否得到增强。三是做共同发展的积极贡献者。没有发展，一切人权都无从谈起，也难以持续。习近平主席提出全球发展倡议，是中国为促进国际人权事业贡献的又一公共产品，已获得联合国和近百个国家的响应支持。四是做公平正义的坚定维护者。评价一个国家是否有人权，不能以别的国家标准来衡量，更不能搞双重标准，甚至把人权当作干涉别国事务的政治工具。要坚定不移推动国际关系民主化和法治化，践行真正的多边主义，推动全球人权治理朝着更加公平合理包容的方向发展。**

   State Councilor Wang Yi put forward a four-point proposition on protecting and promoting human rights. First, we should act as true champions of human rights. Human rights have historical, specific and practical contexts, and the human rights cause can only be advanced in light of each country’s reality and its people’s needs. The economic, political, social, cultural and environmental rights of all should be advanced in a coordinated manner to promote and achieve well-rounded human development. Second, we should act as staunch guardians of people’s interests. A happy life for all is the biggest human right. A country’s human rights are essentially gauged by whether its people’s aspirations for a better life are satisfied; whether their needs, concerns and expectations are addressed; and whether they enjoy a growing sense of fulfillment, happiness and security. Third, we should act as positive contributors to common development. Without development, there would be no human rights to speak of, nor could the rights enjoyed by the people be sustainable. President Xi Jinping has put forth the Global Development Initiative (GDI), which is yet another public good China provides for the development of the global human rights cause. It has been endorsed and supported by the UN and up to 100 countries. Fourth, we should act as firm defenders of equity and justice. In judging whether human rights are upheld in a country, one cannot use other countries’ standards, still less apply double standards or use human rights as a political tool to interfere in the affairs of other countries. We need to steadfastly promote greater democracy and rule of law in international relations, follow true multilateralism, and steer global human rights governance toward greater fairness, equity and inclusiveness.

   **2021年，我们隆重庆祝了中国共产党成立100周年。回顾百年间中国人权事业的发展史，可以说，中国共产党的100年，是团结带领中国人民争取人权、尊重人权、保障人权、发展人权的100年。在中国共产党领导下，中国7.7亿农村贫困人口摆脱贫困，历史性解决了绝对贫困问题，全面建成小康社会，创造了中国式现代化新道路。在抗击新冠肺炎疫情过程中，我们奉行人民至上、生命至上，最大限度保护了人民生命安全和身体健康。**

   In 2021, we solemnly commemorated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Looking back on the development of China’s human rights cause in the past 100 years, it is fair to say that the CPC’s 100-year history records its efforts in fighting for, respecting, protecting, and developing human rights. Under the CPC’s leadership, 770 million rural poor have been lifted out of poverty and a historic resolution to the problem of absolute poverty is achieved. China built a moderately prosperous society in all respects and pioneered a new and uniquely Chinese path to modernization. Throughout our fight against COVID-19, we put the people and human lives first and protected the people’s safety and health to the greatest extent.

   **展望未来，中国将坚定不移走顺应时代发展潮流、适合本国国情的人权发展道路，坚持以人民为中心的人权理念，不断发展全过程人民民主，促进全体人民共同富裕，在更高水平保障中国人民的人权。中国将继续积极参与联合国人权事务，发出中国声音，作出中国贡献，同各国一道推动全球人权事业健康发展。**

   Going forward, China will continue to steadfastly pursue a human rights development path that meets the trend of the times and suits its national conditions. We will continue to uphold a human rights philosophy that puts people front and center, develop the whole-process people’s democracy, promote common prosperity for all, and safeguard the human rights of the Chinese people at a higher level. We will continue to take an active part in UN human rights endeavors by making China’s voice heard and contributing China’s part to this worthy cause. China will work with all countries to advance the sound development of the global human rights cause.

7. **路透社记者：昨天你说到，一国安全不能建立在损害别国安全的基础之上，更不能出于寻求自身绝对军事优势和绝对安全而肆意损害别国主权和安全。我们这里想请你澄清一下，你说的一个国家是不是指俄罗斯？还是别的其他国家？**

   Reuters: You said yesterday that one country’s security cannot be at the expense of others’ security; still less should one country flagrantly undermine others’ sovereignty and security for its own absolute military advantage and absolute security. We would like to clarify, do you mean Russia or some other country?

   **汪文斌：你提到的这个问题，我可以给你一个清晰的解释。正如王毅国务委员兼外长所指出的，中方一贯倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，认为一国的安全不能以损害他国安全为代价，地区安全更不能以强化甚至扩张军事集团来保障。冷战思维应当彻底摒弃。各国的合理安全关切应当予以尊重。在北约连续五轮东扩情况下，俄罗斯在安全方面的正当诉求理应得到重视和妥善解决。我不知道你清楚了没有。**

   Wang Wenbin: I can give you a clear explanation. As noted by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, China advocates common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. China believes that the security of one country should not come at the expense of the security of other countries, still less should regional security be guaranteed by strengthening or even expanding military blocs. The Cold War mentality should be discarded completely. The legitimate security concerns of all countries should be respected. Given NATO’s five consecutive rounds of eastward expansion, Russia's legitimate security demands ought to be taken seriously and properly addressed. I hope I’ve made it clear enough.

8. **法新社记者：周一，乌克兰哈尔科夫居民区有至少11人在轰炸中丧生。周日，乌克兰卫生部称，目前至少352名平民在冲突中丧生。中方对此有何评论？**

   AFP: On Monday, at least 11 people were killed by shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine. Ukraine’s health ministry said on Sunday that at least 352 civilians have been killed so far in the entire conflict. What’s your comment? 

   **汪文斌：乌克兰问题有着复杂的历史经纬和现实情况。中方对有关伤亡情况感到遗憾。目前的局势是我们不愿看到的。当务之急是各方保持必要克制，避免乌克兰现地事态继续恶化甚至走向失控。平民的生命财产安全应当得到有效保障，尤其要防止出现大规模人道主义危机。**

   Wang Wenbin: The Ukraine issue has complex historical context and realistic factors. The Chinese side regrets the casualties. The current situation is not what we want to see. The top priority is for all parties to exercise necessary restraint to prevent the situation on the ground in Ukraine from deteriorating or even spiraling out of control. The life and property safety of civilians should be effectively guaranteed, and in particular, large-scale humanitarian crises should be averted. 

9. **彭博社记者：据《纽约时报》报道，已有约50万人撤离乌克兰。中方仍未将俄罗斯举动定义为“入侵”，你认为该怎么定义俄罗斯的行动呢？**

   Bloomberg: The New York Times has reported that some 500,000 people have fled Ukraine, and as yet, China hasn’t described this as an invasion. How would you like to characterize Russia’s activities in the Ukraine?

   **汪文斌：你提的问题，我们已经多次回答过，你可以查阅。我想强调的是，中方在乌克兰问题上的立场是一贯的，我们在乌克兰问题上没有私利。中方一向根据乌克兰问题本身的是非曲直决定我们的立场。**

   Wang Wenbin: We have answered this question many times. You may refer to that. I want to stress that China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent. We have no selfish interests on the Ukraine issue. China always decides its position based on the merits of the Ukraine issue itself.

10. **路透社记者：台湾已经发送一些救援物资到乌克兰。请问中方是否准备向乌克兰提供人道援助？**

    Reuters: Taiwan has sent relief supplies to Ukraine. Is China prepared to provide humanitarian assistance to the country?

    **汪文斌：中方愿为缓和乌克兰局势发挥建设性作用。相关消息我们会适时发布。**

    Wang Wenbin: China is ready to play a constructive role in easing the situation in Ukraine. We will release relevant information in due course.

11. **路透社记者：乌克兰危机是否会使俄罗斯减少自欧洲进口并增加对中国商品的需求？人民币会在中俄双边贸易中发挥更大作用吗？** 

    Reuters: Will the crisis boost Russian demand for Chinese goods as it shifts away from imports from Europe and also envisages a bigger role of Yuan in bilateral trade with Russia?

    **汪文斌：我们认为，制裁从来不是解决问题的根本有效办法。中方也一贯反对任何非法的单边制裁。中俄双方将继续本着相互尊重、平等互利的精神开展正常的贸易合作。**

    Wang Wenbin: As we have repeatedly said, we believe that sanctions are not an effective solution to solve problems. It is China’s consistent position that we oppose all illegal unilateral sanctions. China and Russia will continue to carry out normal trade cooperation following the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.

12. **会后有记者问及：据报道，近期已经有中国公民撤出了乌克兰。能否介绍具体情况和中方所做工作？后续还有哪些撤离安排？**

    The following question was raised after the press conference: Some Chinese citizens have reportedly left Ukraine recently. Can you share some details and the work China has done? What are the follow-up evacuation arrangements?

    **汪文斌：乌克兰局势发生变化以来，党中央、国务院始终高度重视、十分牵挂在乌中国公民安全。外交部已第一时间启动领事保护应急机制，与各方保持密切沟通，多方协调，多措并举，全力维护在乌同胞安全。**

    Wang Wenbin: Since changes have taken place in the Ukraine situation, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance to and have been concerned about the safety of Chinese citizens in Ukraine. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has immediately activated the emergency mechanism for consular protection, stayed in close communication with all parties for coordination, and put our hearts to ensuring the safety of our compatriots in Ukraine with a range of measures.

    **目前，在乌中国公民正通过多种方式向乌周边国家转移。在此过程中，外交部、中国驻乌克兰使馆、驻敖德萨总领馆和中国驻摩尔多瓦、斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、波兰等周边国家使馆想方设法，调动一切资源力量，为在乌同胞安全转移提供支持和协助，迄今已有约千名在乌中国公民安全转移。**

    At present, Chinese citizens in Ukraine are heading to neighboring countries of Ukraine in various ways. In this process, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Embassy in Ukraine, the Chinese Consulate General in Odessa, and embassies in Ukraine’s neighboring countries including Moldova, Slovakia, Romania and Poland have found ways and mobilized all resources and forces possible to provide support and assistance for our compatriots in Ukraine. About 1,000 Chinese citizens in Ukraine have so far safely relocated.

    **中方感谢乌克兰各界以及乌周边各有关国家对中国公民的帮助和关照，也期待各方履行国际责任，确保平民的生命财产安全。同时再次提醒在乌中国公民增强安全意识，同我驻乌及周边国家使领馆及时保持联系，切实加强自身安全防范。**

    China is grateful for the help and support rendered by all sectors in Ukraine and relevant neighboring countries. We hope all sides will fulfill their international obligations to ensure the safety of lives and property of civilians. Again, we remind Chinese citizens in Ukraine to enhance safety awareness, keep in touch with Chinese embassies and consulates in Ukraine and neighboring countries and strengthen their own security precautions in real earnest.

1. **《中国日报》记者：3月1日，美国国务卿布林肯在联合国人权理事会第49届会议发表视频讲话称，中国政府持续对新疆维族穆斯林和其他少数民族犯下“种族灭绝”和“反人类”罪行。中方对此有何回应？**

   China Daily: On March 1, the US **Secretary of State** Antony Blinken said in his video address at the 49th session of the UN Human Rights Council that the Chinese government continues to commit **genocide** and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang against Muslim Uyghurs and other minority groups. Do you have any response?

   >1. genocide[ˈdʒenəsaɪd]：**N-UNCOUNT**种族灭绝；大屠杀

   汪文斌：我们谴责美方再次散布谎言对中方进行抹黑攻击。

   Wang Wenbin: We condemn the latest US moves to smear and attack China by spreading lies. 

   灭绝种族有严格的定义。根据联合国大会1948年12月通过的《防止及惩治灭绝种族罪公约》，灭绝种族是指为了“全部或部分消灭特定团体”而实施的暴行。美国建国以来对印第安人进行大肆屠杀，使印第安人口数量从1492年的500万锐减到20世纪初的25万，这才是不折不扣的种族灭绝。美国原住民历史学家罗克珊·邓巴－奥尔蒂斯认为，《防止及惩治灭绝种族罪公约》关于灭绝种族所列举的5项罪状中的每一条都能在美国针对印第安人的罪行中找到对应。今天，外交部网站发布了《美国对印第安人实施种族灭绝的历史事实和现实证据》一文，详细介绍了美国犯下的灭绝种族罪行，欢迎大家查阅。

   The word “genocide” has rigorous definition. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide adopted by the **United Nations General Assembly** in December 1948 defined the crime of genocide as acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”. Since its founding, the US has slaughtered the Native Americans, whose population **nosedived** from five million in 1492 to 250,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. This is **nothing short of** genocide. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, an American historian dedicated to the study of **indigenous** peoples, concluded that all five acts of genocide listed in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide can be found in the crimes the US committed against American Indians. Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released on its website a report titled “The American Genocide of the Indians—Historical Facts and Real Evidence”. It details crimes of genocide committed by the US. You may refer to that. 

   > 1. nosedive[ˈnəʊzdaɪv]：**VERB**(名声或事业)一落千丈，急转直下
   >
   > 2. short of：**PHRASE**可以说是;简直;无异于

   > You use **nothing short of** or **little short of** to emphasize how great or extreme something is. For example, if you say that something is **nothing short of** a miracle or **nothing short of** disastrous, you are emphasizing that it is a miracle or it is disastrous.

   > 3. indigenous[ɪnˈdɪdʒənəs]：**ADJ**当地的;本土的;土生土长的

   中国新疆地区过去60多年来，人口总量增长了4倍，维吾尔族人口总量从220万增长到约1200万。说新疆“种族灭绝”，是彻头彻尾的“世纪谎言”，毫无道德可言。

    Over the past 60-plus years, the population in China’s Xinjiang region increased **fourfold** and the Uyghur population grew from 2.2 million to about 12 million. The accusation of “genocide” in Xinjiang is a **flat-out** lie of the century. Those who make this accusation are totally **unethical**. 

    > 1. fourfold：四倍的
    > 2. flat-out：最高的，坦白的，直率的
    > 3. unethical：**ADJ-GRADED**不道德的；不合乎道德标准的

   这一“世纪谎言”的最大推手是美国国内的一些反华势力。美国上届政府执政末期，蓬佩奥抛出新疆“种族灭绝”的谎言。尽管当时连美国国务院的律师都认为这种说法站不住脚，但蓬出于反华政治目的，仍将其作为抹黑攻击中国的主要工具。美国新政府上台后，不仅没有肃清上届政府炮制谎言、抹黑中国的遗毒，反而继承其衣钵，继续操弄谎言对中国进行污蔑抹黑，妄图破坏中国民族团结、干扰中国发展。

      People behind this lie of the century are mainly anti-China forces in the US. Toward the end of the last administration’s term in office, Mike Pompeo fabricated the lie of “genocide” in Xinjiang. Even though lawyers of the US State Department called this argument **untenable**, Pompeo insisted on using it as a main tool to smear and attack China to serve his anti-China political goals. After the new US administration came in office, instead of **rooting out** the former administration’s poisonous legacy of **concocting** lies to smear China, it inherited the approach of manipulating lies to **denigrate** China, in an attempt to undermine China’s **ethnic unity** and **hobble** China’s development.

   > 1. untenable：**ADJ-GRADED**（论点、理论或立场）经不起反驳的，不堪一击的，站不住脚的
   > 2. root out：**PHRASAL VERB**铲除;清除**PHRASAL VERB**根除;杜绝;彻底解决
   > 3. concoct[kənˈkɒkt]：**VERB**编造;捏造
   > 4. denigrate[ˈdenɪgreɪt]：**VERB**贬低;诋毁;侮辱
   > 5. hobble：**VERB**妨碍;阻碍

   我也注意到，有媒体披露美国政府制定涉疆宣传策略、有组织散布涉疆负面信息的具体手法，包括鼓励美国学术机构、智库、非政府组织持续炮制所谓涉疆“研究报告”，出版相关书籍；美国际媒体署管理的新闻机构按指令用几十种语言制作有关新疆“种族灭绝”“强迫劳动”的虚假新闻报道和宣传品、炒作宗教敏感话题，协调盟国媒体机构转载推送；美国的互联网媒体“技术入股”，一方面弱化、屏蔽中方发布的涉疆真实信息，另一方面为反华势力传播涉疆虚假信息“开外挂”“配装备”，美国政府为此提供了重金资助。

   I also noted media reports that revealed the US’ specific measures to formulate Xinjiang-related propaganda strategies and spread negative information about Xinjiang in an organized manner. They include encouraging US academic institutions, think tanks and non-governmental organizations to constantly fabricate so-called research reports about Xinjiang and publish related books. News agencies **overseen** by the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) are instructed to produce fake news reports and “propaganda materials” about “genocide” and “forced labor” in Xinjiang in dozens of languages and **hype up** religious and sensitive topics. In the meanwhile, the USAGM coordinates with media networks in US ally countries to reprint and push such “products”. The US online media also **chip in** technologically through weakening and blocking true information about Xinjiang released by the Chinese side while providing technical assistance for anti-China forces to spread false information related to the region. Such efforts are also financially supported by the US government.

   > 1. overseen
   > 2. hype up
   > 3. chip in

   在这条涉疆谎言的生产链条当中，美国政府自导自演、自产自销，直接主导了涉疆谎言的炮制和传播。这与美前高官威尔克森亲口承认的美试图煽动维吾尔族“从内部搞乱中国”遥相呼应，充分暴露了美借涉疆问题破坏中国稳定和发展的真实意图。

   As people can tell, in this production line of Xinjiang-related lies, the US government directly dominates the fabrication and **dissemination** by staging the show and marketing what it produces. This latest revelation echoes the personal statement by former US senior official Lawrence Wilkerson, who admitted that the US tries to **incite** Uyghurs and destabilize China from within. It fully reveals the US real intention to undermine China’s stability and development by exploiting Xinjiang-related issues.

   > 1. dissemination
   > 2. incite

   但谎言谣言在事实真相面前终将不攻自破。近年来，来自100多个国家的2000多位专家、学者、记者、外交官、宗教界人士等各界人士参访新疆，他们目睹了新疆社会安定、经济发展、人民幸福的事实。在联合国人权理事会上，近百个国家一致支持中国政府的治疆政策，反对以人权为借口干涉中国内政。而少数附和美国的国家当中，没有一个是穆斯林国家。国际上越来越多的有识之士在涉疆问题上发出理性、客观的声音。

   Lies and rumors will eventually **shatter** into pieces in front of facts and truth. In recent years, more than 2,000 experts, scholars, journalists, diplomats and religious **personnel** from over 100 countries have visited Xinjiang. They have seen first-hand the facts about social stability, economic development and people’s happy life in Xinjiang. At the UN Human Rights Council, almost 100 countries **unanimously** expressed support for the Chinese government’s policy in Xinjiang and opposition to **interference** in China’s internal affairs in the name of human rights. None of the handful of countries that **echoed** the US’ position is a Muslim country. More and more **visionary** people are making rational and objective voices on Xinjiang-related issues.

   > 1. shatter
   > 2. personnel
   > 3. unanimously
   > 4. interference
   > 5. echo
   > 6. echoed

   我要强调的是，新疆的大门是敞开的，我们欢迎不带偏见的各国人士到新疆参访交流。美国政客散布谎言抹黑中国，只会让他们自己名誉扫地，让世人看清其险恶用心。

   I want to stress that the door to Xinjiang is wide open. We welcome all unbiased people from all countries to visit Xinjiang. The US politicians’ move to **discredit** China by spreading lies will only damage their reputation and expose their **sinister** intention to the world.

2. **塔斯社记者：昨天中乌外长通电话时，乌克兰外长表示期待中方为实现乌俄停火开展斡旋。中方是否愿意就此采取一些具体措施？**

   TASS: In the phone conversation between Chinese and Ukrainian foreign ministers yesterday, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister said he looked forward to China’s **mediation** efforts for the ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Is China willing to take some concrete measures toward this end?

   > 1. mediation

   汪文斌：中方一直支持和鼓励一切有利于和平解决乌克兰危机的外交努力，欢迎俄乌双方启动和平谈判，希望双方继续保持对话谈判进程，寻求照顾双方合理安全关切的政治解决之道。中方将继续为推动乌克兰局势缓和发挥建设性作用。

   Wang Wenbin: China always supports and encourages all diplomatic efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis and welcomes Russia and Ukraine’s effort to start peace talks. We hope both sides will continue to maintain the process of dialogue and negotiation, seek a political solution that accommodates the legitimate security concerns of both sides. China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting the deescalation of the situation in Ukraine. 

3. **新华社记者：近日，多家国际机构下调了今年全球经济增速预期。与此同时，我们看到，国家统计局日前发布的2021年国民经济和社会发展统计公报显示，去年中国国内生产总值比上年增长8.1％。各方普遍认为，中国依然是推动世界经济增长的主要引擎。发言人对此有何评论？**

   Xinhua News Agency: Recently, several international institutions have cut forecasts for global economic growth this year. In the meantime, we noted that the Statistical Communiqué of the People’s Republic of China on the 2021 National Economic and Social Development released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said China’s GDP grew by 8.1% year on year in 2021. It is a widely shared view that China remains a main engine driving global economic growth. What’s your comment?

   汪文斌：2021年，虽然受到国内外经济环境变化带来的压力和挑战，中国经济依然保持较好发展态势，成就斐然，亮点纷呈。

   Wang Wenbin: Despite pressure and challenges arising from the changing economic environment at home and abroad, China’s economy **maintained sound development momentum** and achieved outstanding performance with many highlights in 2021. 

   去年中国经济总量和人均水平都实现了新突破。经济规模达到114.4万亿元，按年均汇率折算为17.7万亿美元，预计占世界经济比重超过18％，对世界经济增长贡献率达到25％左右。人均GDP突破8万元，超过世界人均GDP水平。中国消费结构持续升级，创新活力不断释放，国家创新能力综合排名上升到世界第12位。这些都是中国经济在高质量发展轨道上行稳致远的底气所在。

   In 2021, China’s economy has made new breakthroughs both in **aggregate** and **per capita** terms. China’s economy reached 114.4 trillion yuan, equivalent to $17.7 trillion at the yearly average exchange rate, accounting for more than 18% of the world economy and contributing about 25% to global growth. China’s per capita GDP exceeded 80,000 yuan, surpassing the world average. Its consumption structure has continued to upgrade and the vitality for innovation continued to be **unleashed**, and overall innovation capability ranking has risen to the 12th place in the world. All this boosts the confidence in the steady and sustained operation of China’s economy along the **trajectory** of high-quality development. 

   > 1. aggregate
   > 2. per capita
   > 3. unleashed
   > 4. trajectory

   特别值得一提的是，尽管全球经贸合作遭遇冲击，但中国顶住了压力，坚定不移扩大对外开放，致力维护全球产业链供应链稳定。去年，中国货物贸易进出口总值达39.1万亿元，同比增长21.4％，规模再创历史新高。在利用外资方面，中国去年首次突破1万亿元，达到1.15万亿元，增速达14.9％，是近十年来首次实现两位数增长，充分说明外国投资者对中国广阔市场机遇和良好营商环境充满信心。

   It is particularly worth mentioning that though global economic and trade cooperation has experienced **setbacks**, China has **bucked** the trend and firmly expanded opening-up with the commitment to safeguarding stable global industrial and supply chains. In 2021, the total value of China’s trade in goods was 39.1 trillion yuan, up 21.4% year on year, hitting a new record high. China’s actual use of **foreign capital** last year exceeded the one trillion yuan mark for the first time, reaching 1.15 trillion yuan with an increase of 14.9%, the first double-digit growth rate in nearly a decade. This indicates that foreign investors are fully confident in the opportunities offered by China’s broad market and its sound business environment.

   > 1. setback
   > 2. buck
   > 3. foreign capital：外资

   上述事实和数据表明，中国经济发展韧性强、潜力足、长期向好的基本面没有变，中国经济稳定恢复的态势没有变。国际社会普遍看好中国经济持续稳健发展的前景。

   All these facts and statistics show that the Chinese economy has strong resilience and ample potential, and the fundamentals sustaining the long-term growth and the momentum for steady recovery remain unchanged. The international public opinion has an **upbeat** **outlook** on Chinese economy’s sustained and steady development.

   > 1. upbeat
   > 2. outlook

   我们愿继续同各方加强合作，同世界分享发展机遇，为全球经济持续复苏注入持久动力，共同续写经济增长和可持续发展的“成功故事”。

   We **stand ready** to strengthen cooperation with all parties, share in development opportunities with the world, inject endurable **impetus** into the sustained recovery of the world economy and jointly add new chapters to the successful stories of economic growth and sustainable development.

4. **西班牙《阿贝赛报》记者：习近平主席会在未来几天与乌克兰总统泽连斯基通话吗？是否就此作了准备？**

   ABC Spanish Daily Newspaper: Will President Xi hold a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in future days? Has there been any preparation **in this regard**?

   > 1. in this regard：【正式】在这方面；在这一点上

   汪文斌：中乌之间保持着畅通的沟通渠道。

   Wang Wenbin: China and Ukraine have **smooth communication channels**. 

5. **东京电视台记者：第一个问题，中国会不会持续购买俄罗斯的天然气？第二个问题，目前西方国家都在制裁俄罗斯，中国坚持与俄罗斯开展正常贸易将对中方产生何种影响？**

   TV Tokyo: Firstly, will China continue to buy natural gas from Russia? Secondly, many Western countries have imposed sanctions on Russia but China is still having normal trade with the country. Will this have any impact on China?

   汪文斌：我们已经多次回答过相关问题。我愿重申，中方坚决反对**任何非法单边制裁**。制裁从来不是解决问题的根本有效途径，只会给相关国家的经济和民生带来严重困难，进一步加剧分裂和对抗。我们要求有关方面在处理乌克兰问题和对俄关系时，不得损害中方和其他方面的正当权益。中俄双方将继续本着相互尊重、平等互利精神开展正常贸易合作。

   > 反对任何非法单边制裁：也就是说，如果是合法的，或者是联合国的多边制裁，我们是可以接受的。现在有反外国制裁法，所以我们可以制裁反华政客和美国。

   Wang Wenbin: We have answered relevant question **multiple times**. I would like to **reiterate** that China firmly opposes all illegal unilateral sanctions, and believes that sanctions are never fundamentally effective means to solve problems. They will only create serious difficulties to the economy and livelihood of relevant countries and further intensify division and **confrontation**. We ask the relevant parties not to hurt the legitimate rights and interests of China and other parties when handling the Ukraine issue and the relations with Russia. China and Russia will continue to conduct normal trade cooperation in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.

6. **法新社记者：第一个问题，据报道，一名中国公民日前在乌克兰遭遇枪击受伤。你对此有何评论？第二个问题，乌克兰外长库列巴在与王毅国务委员通话时表示，期待中方为实现乌俄停火开展斡旋。中方答应了他的要求吗？**

   AFP: Firstly, there were reports of a Chinese national who was injured by a bullet in Ukraine. Do you have any comment? Secondly, during a call with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was quoted as saying that Ukraine looks forward to China launching mediations to bring about a ceasefire. Has China committed to these mediations? 

   汪文斌：关于第一个问题，北京时间3月1日晚，一名中国公民在自行撤离途中遭遇枪击受伤。中国驻乌克兰大使馆第一时间联系当事人提供协助。据了解，伤者暂已脱离生命危险。驻乌克兰使馆将继续关注伤者情况并提供协助。

   Wang Wenbin: On your first question, on the evening of March 1, Beijing time, a Chinese citizen was injured by gunfire while leaving Ukraine. The Chinese Embassy in Ukraine immediately contacted the person concerned to provide assistance. It is learned that the injured person is out of danger **for the time being**. The Chinese Embassy in Ukraine will continue to monitor the situation of the injured and provide assistance.

   > 1. for the time being

   >    At the present moment; for now.

   借此机会，我也想跟大家补充一些信息。连日来，外交部及驻有关国家使领馆多方协调、多措并举，支持协助在乌中国公民通过多种方式向乌克兰周边国家转移。目前，有关工作在各方的共同努力下有序推进。

   **On this occasion**, I would also like to give you some updates on the relevant situation. For days, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chinese embassies and **consulates** in relevant countries have coordinated with relevant sides and taken various measures to help Chinese citizens in Ukraine relocate to Ukraine’s neighboring countries through multiple channels. With the **concerted** efforts of all sides, relevant work is well **underway** **in an orderly fashion**. 

   > 1. consulate
   > 2. concerted
   > 3. underway

   外交部及驻有关国家使领馆将继续全力保护在乌中国公民安全，持续为转移撤离同胞提供支持和协助。请在乌中国同胞不论在驻地还是在旅途当中，注意安全，规避风险。

   The Foreign Ministry and Chinese embassies and consulates in relevant countries will continue to spare no effort in protecting the safety of Chinese citizens and providing support and help for their evacuation and relocation. We hope our **compatriots** in Ukraine can stay safe and avert risks when staying somewhere or traveling.

   > 1. compatriot

   关于第二个问题，我刚才已经回答过了。我们一向支持和鼓励一切有利于和平解决乌克兰危机的外交努力，将继续为推动缓和乌克兰局势发挥建设性作用。

   On your second question, I just gave my answer. We support and encourage all diplomatic efforts conducive to peacefully resolving the Ukraine crisis. We will continue to play a constructive role in deescalating the Ukraine situation.

7. **总台国广记者：据报道，埃塞俄比亚提格雷州武装指责联邦政府阻碍人道主义救援物资进入该州，并于近期同阿法尔州武装发生交火。中方对此有何评论？**

   CRI: The Tigray forces reportedly accused the **Ethiopian** federal government of blocking humanitarian aid supplies from entering the state, and **exchanged fire** with the forces in the Afar state recently. What is China’s comment on this?

   > 1. Ethiopian

   汪文斌：我们注意到，一段时间以来，埃塞俄比亚政府主动宣布暂不攻入提格雷州，决定提前结束全国紧急状态，并积极筹备全国包容性政治对话，对缓和埃塞北部局势具有积极意义。作为埃塞俄比亚人民的真诚朋友，中方呼吁有关各方相向而行，通过对话谈判化解分歧，重返国家和平、发展和振兴道路。我们愿继续为此发挥积极和建设性作用。

   Wang Wenbin: We noticed that the Ethiopian government has declared to halt advances on Tigray, put an early end to the national state of emergency, and has been actively preparing for an inclusive political dialogue nationwide for some time, which have positive significance for easing the situation in north Ethiopia. As a sincere friend of the Ethiopian people, China calls on all relevant parties to work together to resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation and bring the country back onto the track of peace, development and **revitalization**. We are ready to continue to play an active and constructive part in this regard.

8. **法新社记者：美国发布旅行警告称，因当地防疫措施严格，且父母与子女可能被分开隔离，提醒美国公民不要前往香港。中方对此有何评论？**

   AFP: The US issued a travel advisory warning citizens not to travel to Hong Kong due to strict coronavirus measures and the risk of parent-child separation. What’s your response to this?

   汪文斌：香港特区政府采取的防疫举措是为了有效防控疫情，切实保护香港居民及在港外国人的健康。有关措施是必要、科学和负责任的做法。我们相信，相关防疫举措将进一步增强国际社会对香港防疫的信心，保障香港与国际社会安全有序交往，为国际投资者在香港投资兴业提供更加安全稳定的营商环境。

   Wang Wenbin: The Hong Kong SAR government’s COVID-19 protocols are aimed at effectively **containing** the virus and protecting the health of Hong Kong residents and foreign nationals in the SAR. They are necessary, science-based and responsible. We believe these anti-epidemic measures will further enhance the international community’s confidence in Hong Kong’s COVID-19 response, ensure safe and orderly exchanges between Hong Kong and the rest of the world, and provide a safer and more stable business environment for international investors.

9. **路透社记者：所有在乌中国公民都是通过大巴、火车等方式从陆路撤离的吗？**

   Reuters: Are all Chinese evacuations done over land only, by buses or trains? 

   汪文斌：外交部和中国驻乌克兰使馆一直在持续跟踪评估乌克兰当地安全风险，协调各有关方面，争取一切可用资源，在确保安全前提下协助在乌中国公民有序撤离。

   Wang Wenbin: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Embassy in Ukraine are monitoring and assessing the security risks in Ukraine and coordinating with relevant sides to mobilize all useful resources, in order to help Chinese citizens in Ukraine evacuate in an orderly manner under the precondition of ensuring their safety. 

10. **共同社记者：据报道，今天美国前参联会主席与台湾地区领导人进行了会谈。中方对此有何评论？**

    Kyodo News: It is reported that former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US had talks with the leader of the Taiwan region. Do you have any comment?

    汪文斌：昨天我们已经回答过相关问题，你可以查阅。我想再次强调，中国人民捍卫国家主权和领土完整的决心和意志坚定不移。美方派任何人展示所谓对台支持都是徒劳的。

    Wang Wenbin: I would like to refer you to my answer to a relevant question yesterday. I want to stress again that the Chinese people are firmly determined and resolved to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The attempt by the US to show support to Taiwan will be in vain, no matter who the US sends.

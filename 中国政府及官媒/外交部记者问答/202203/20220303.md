1. **湖北广播电视台记者：据报道，3月2日，网络安全企业360公司发布《网络战序幕：美国国安局NSA（APT-C-40）对全球发起长达十余年无差别攻击》的报告，批露NSA利用网络武器对中国、英国、德国、法国、波兰、日本、印度、韩国、阿联酋、南非、巴西等全球47个国家及地区403个目标开展网络攻击。此前，360公司还发布过APT-C-39报告，曝光美国中央情报局对中国发动大规模网络攻击。请问，中方对此有何评论？**

   Hubei Media Group: It is reported that on March 2, **the internet security company named 360** released a report on the **indiscriminate** cyberattack launched by the US National Security Agency’s APT-C-40 group over the past decade or so. The report reveals that the NSA used cyberweapons to launch cyberattacks against 403 targets in 47 countries and regions around the world, including China, the UK, Germany, France, Poland, Japan, India, the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Brazil. Actually, 360 earlier released a report on APT-C-39 who works under the US Central Intelligence Agency and launched large-scale cyber attacks on China. Do you have any comment?

   > 1. indiscriminate[ˌɪndɪˈskrɪmɪnət]：**ADJ-GRADED**不加区别的;不加选择的

   汪文斌：我们注意到360公司的有关报告，谴责报告曝光的恶意网络活动，再次强烈敦促美方作出解释，并立即停止此类活动。中方将采取必要措施维护中国的网络安全和自身利益。

   360公司此前曾经发布APT-C-39报告，上周北京奇安盘古实验室刚发布美对中国网络攻击报告，再到这次APT-C-40报告。这一系列报告表明，美对中国进行了大规模、长时间、系统性的网络攻击，严重危害中国关键基础设施安全、海量个人数据安全以及商业和技术秘密，严重影响了中美在网络空间的互信。相关报告显示，美国在网络空间没有遵守任何国际规则，也彻底抛弃了中美2015年达成的网络安全双边共识。

   具有讽刺意味的是，作为全球头号“黑客帝国”，美还以“受害者”形象，误导国际社会，试图主导网络安全国际议程。美方发起了“打击勒索软件倡议”，酝酿成立所谓“未来互联网联盟”，成立各种小圈子讨论供应链安全问题。值得注意的是，美方近来还以提升网络能力为由，加大与中国部分周边国家的网络安全合作，包括东亚、东南亚、南亚和中亚。根据中国网络安全公司的系列报告，很多与美有合作的国家也是美国网络攻击目标。

   网络空间是人类的共同家园，网络攻击是全球面临的共同威胁。中方再次强烈要求美国停止针对中国和全球的网络窃密和攻击，切实采取负责任的态度，与各方一道共同维护网络空间和平与安全。

   Wang Wenbin: We have noted the report released by 360. China condemns the malicious cyber activities exposed in the report. We strongly urge the US to give an explanation and stop such activities. China will take necessary measures to safeguard its cybersecurity and interests.  

   From 360’s APT-C-39 report to Beijing-based  Qi  An  Pangu Lab’s report on US cyberattacks against China released last week and this latest APT-C-40 report, they show that the US has conducted large-scale and systemic cyberattacks on China for a long time. Such activities have gravely endangered the security of China’s **key infrastructure**, a  large  amount  of personal data and commercial and technological secrets, and seriously undermined China-US mutual trust in cyberspace. The relevant reports reveal that the US did not abide by any international rule in cyberspace and completely violated the **bilateral** consensus on cybersecurity reached in 2015.  

   > 1. bilateral[ˌbaɪˈlætərəl]：**ADJ**（谈判、会议、协议等）双边的

   The US is **unrivalled** in malicious cyber activities. Ironically, it **presents itself as a victim**, misleads the international community and attempts to dominate the international agenda of cybersecurity. The US launched the International Counter-Ransomware Initiative, brewed the establishment of the Alliance for the Future of the Internet, and put together small cliques of all sorts to discuss the security of supply chain. It is worth noting that the US recently stepped up cybersecurity cooperation with China’s neighboring countries, including those in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and Central Asia, in the name of enhancing cyber capabilities. Many countries in cooperation with the US are also targets of US cyber attacks, according to report series by Chinese cybersecurity companies.

   > 1. unrivalled：**ADJ**无与伦比的；无可匹敌的；无双的

   Cyberspace is a shared homeland for humanity, and cyberattacks are a common challenge faced by all countries. China again strongly urges the US to stop cyber **espionage** and attacks on China and the whole world, and join others to jointly safeguard peace and security in cyberspace with a responsible attitude.

2. **《中国日报》记者：据报道，近日，美常驻联合国代表团发表声明称，根据《联合国和美国关于联合国总部的协定》，美将驱逐12名俄罗斯常驻联合国代表团外交官，原因是相关人员从事危害美国家安全的间谍行动。请问中方对此有何评论？**

   China Daily: It is reported that the US Mission to the UN recently said in a statement that the US decided to **expel** 12 Russian diplomats of the **Russian Permanent Mission to the UN** for “espionage activities that are adverse to our national security” in accordance with the UN Headquarters Agreement. Do you have any comment?

   > 1. expel：**VERB**逐出;驱逐**VERB**开除;将…除名

   汪文斌：中方对美方做法感到关切，希望美方就此作出详尽说明。作为联合国东道国，美方应当善意履行《联合国和美国关于联合国总部的协定》，为会员国外交官正常履职提供应有的便利和保障，而不应滥用东道国权力，随意单方面作出决定。

   Wang Wenbin: China is concerned about the US action and hopes the US can offer a detailed explanation. As a host country of the United Nations, the US should implement the United Nations Headquarters Agreement **with good will**, and provide **due** convenience and facilitation for the normal fulfillment of duty by diplomats of UN member states, instead of **abusing its capacity** as a host country and **willfully** making unilateral decisions.

3. **彭博社记者：周三，联合国大会投票赞成谴责俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，并要求俄撤军。中国是投弃权票的会员国之一。外交部能否对此作出解释？**

   Bloomberg: On Wednesday, the **UN General Assembly** voted to condemn Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and demanded it withdraw its forces. China **abstained from** that vote. Does the foreign ministry have a comment on why China abstained from that vote?

   汪文斌：中国常驻联合国代表张军大使已就中方的投票立场作了解释性发言。

   中方在乌克兰问题上的基本立场是一贯、明确的。我们始终主张尊重各国主权和领土完整，根据联合国宪章宗旨和原则和平解决国际争端。当前最重要的是尽可能缓解当地局势，避免冲突升级甚至失控。

   联合国和有关各方采取的任何行动，都要以地区和平稳定为重，以各方普遍安全为重，为紧张局势降温、推动外交解决起到正面作用。遗憾的是，本次紧急特别联大表决的相关决议草案，事先没有在全体会员国范围内进行充分磋商，没有全面考虑当前危机背后的历史经纬和复杂矛盾，没有强调安全不可分割原则的重要性，也没有突出推动政治解决、加大外交努力的紧迫性。这些都与中方一贯坚持的立场主张不符，我们不得不对决议草案投了弃权票。

   我们呼吁国际社会本着负责任态度，推动有关各方尽快回到政治解决的轨道上来，通过对话协商寻求乌克兰问题的全面解决。中方愿继续为此发挥建设性作用。

   Wang Wenbin: Ambassador Zhang Jun, Permanent Representative of China **to** the UN, already gave an explanation of the vote.  

   China’s basic position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear. We always advocate respect for the **sovereignty** and **territorial integrity** of all countries, and peaceful resolution of international disputes based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The top priority right now is to ease the situation on the ground as much as possible, and prevent the conflicts from **escalating** or even getting out of control.

   > 1. sovereignty[ˈsɒvrənti]：**N-UNCOUNT**(国家的)主权，自主统治权

   >    1. Both unions and management fear the dispute could escalate...
   >
   >       工会和管理层都担心争端会恶化。

   Any action by the UN and the relevant parties should give priority to regional peace and stability and the universal security of all parties. It is important to play a positive role in cooling the situation and facilitating diplomatic resolution. Regrettably, the draft resolution submitted to this emergency special session for vote has not undergone full consultations within the whole membership. Nor did it take into  full consideration the history and complexity of the current crisis. It did not highlight the importance of the principle of indivisible security, or the urgency of promoting political settlement and stepping up diplomatic efforts. These are not in line with China’s consistent position. Therefore, China had to abstain in the voting.  

   We call on the international community to take a responsible attitude, and bring the relevant parties back to the track of political settlement as soon as possible, and rely on dialogue and consultation to seek a comprehensive resolution of the Ukraine issue. China is ready to continue its constructive role **in this regard**.

4. **日本共同社记者：据台湾媒体报道，美国前国务卿蓬佩奥今天在台北和蔡英文举行了会面。中方有何评论？**

   **Kyodo News: According to Taiwan media reports, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei today. Do you have any comment?**

   汪文斌：蓬佩奥的行径是无耻的，也必然是徒劳的。

   Wang Wenbin: This act of Mike Pompeo is simply shameless and **futile**.  

   > 1. futile[ˈfjuːtl]：**ADJ-GRADED**无益的;无用的;徒劳的

5. **《环球时报》记者：《纽约时报》2日援引西方情报机构报告称，中方高级官员曾告诫俄方高级官员，不要在北京冬奥会期间“入侵”乌克兰。报道称，这表明中方对俄军事行动计划有一定程度了解。中方对此有何评论？**

   **Global Times: The New York Times on March 2 citing a Western intelligence report said that senior Chinese officials told senior Russian officials not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The report indicated that senior Chinese officials had some level of knowledge about Russia’s plans for military actions. What is your comment on this?**

   汪文斌：《纽约时报》的报道纯属虚假信息。这种转移视线、甩锅推责的言论十分卑劣。乌克兰问题演变到今天的这种局面，来龙去脉是很清楚的。究竟症结何在，大家心知肚明。

   近来国际媒体多次提到，美国前驻苏联大使乔治·凯南在上世纪90年代就对美国政府提出忠告，指出北约针对俄罗斯的持续扩张将是美国政策中最致命的错误。遗憾的是，美国政府对此置若罔闻。美国著名国际问题专家托马斯·弗里德曼近日发表文章指出，美国关于“北约东扩”的重大决策失误导致与俄罗斯关系恶化，美政府应该承担相当大的责任。美国前国会众议员加巴德表示，拜登总统只要保证不接纳乌克兰加入北约，就可以结束此次危机，阻止爆发战争，但他们不这样做。

   解铃还须系铃人。希望危机的始作俑者好好反思一下他们在乌克兰危机当中所扮演的角色。切实承担起应尽责任，为缓和局势、解决问题拿出实际行动，而不是嫁祸于人。

   Wang Wenbin: The report by the New York Times is pure fake news. Such practice of diverting attention and **blameshifting** is **despicable**. The ins and outs of the developments of the Ukraine issue are very clear. The **crux** of the issue is known to all.

   > 1. despicable[dɪˈspɪkəbl]：**ADJ-GRADED**可鄙的;卑鄙的
   > 2. crux[krʌks]：**N-SING**(难题或辩论的)关键，最难点，症结

   International media lately mentioned many times that George Kennan, former US ambassador to the Soviet Union, suggested to the US government in the  1990s that expanding NATO up to Russia’s borders would be the most **fateful** error of American policy. Regrettably, the US government turned a deaf ear to this. Thomas Friedman, a famous US expert on international relations, wrote in a recent article that ill-considered decision by the US to expand NATO has undermined the relations with Russia and the US government in early years deserves much of the blame. Tulsi Gabbard, former member of the US House of Representatives, said that the crisis could have been ended and the war easily avoided if President Biden had simply promised not to accept Ukraine’s becoming a member of NATO. But they chose not to do so.

   Those who created the problem should be the ones to undo it. We hope the **culprits** of the crisis can reflect upon their roles in the Ukraine crisis. They should **earnestly** **shoulder due responsibilities** and take real actions to ease the situation and resolve the problem instead of shifting the blame to others.

6. **日本广播协会记者：2013年乌克兰总统访华，同中方签订联合声明，提及中国政府向乌克兰提供安全保证，在乌克兰遭到使用核武器的侵略或受到此种侵略威胁情况下，向乌克兰提供相应安全保证。目前，俄罗斯总统普京命令俄军核力量保持高度戒备状态。请问乌克兰现在是不是可以认为自己受到核武器相关侵略威胁？中方对此有何回应？是否采取措施保障乌克兰安全？**

   NHK: The Ukrainian President visited China in 2013 and signed a joint statement with China saying that the Chinese government will provide security assurances to Ukraine. According to the statement, China will offer relevant security assurances to Ukraine when it is invaded with the use of nuclear weapons or threatened by such invasion. Now, Russian President Putin has ordered the country’s nuclear forces to stay on high alert. Do you think Ukraine is now facing the threat of an invasion of nuclear weapons? Do you have any response to this? Will China take measures to protect Ukraine’s security?

   汪文斌：根据各自国家声明和联合国安理会第984号决议等文件，核武器国家向乌克兰等无核武器国家提供安全保证。这种安全保证有明确的内容限定和触发条件。在乌克兰问题上，当务之急是有关各方保持冷静克制，缓和局势，促进政治解决。

   Wang Wenbin: According to documents such as statements made by states and the UN Security Council Resolution 984, nuclear-weapon states give security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon states  such  as  Ukraine. The security assurances have clear limitations on the content and are triggered under specific conditions. On the Ukraine issue, the pressing task now is for all sides to remain calm and exercise restraint, **deescalate** the situation and promote the political settlement.

7. **深圳卫视记者：美国CNBC新闻网报道，英国内政部调查结果显示，一些香港BNO持有者认为移民成本相当高昂。许多香港专业人才在英国被“大材小用”，只能暂时从事低技能工作。而且在大多数情况下，香港BNO持有者都无法享受社会福利。发言人对此有何评论？**

   Shenzhen TV: According to a report run by the US **media outlet** CNBC, the UK Home Office found that BNO visa holders from Hong Kong said the costs of moving to the UK have been high. Many professionals from Hong Kong are overqualified for new low-skill jobs in the UK. And in most cases, BNO visa holders are not eligible for welfare benefits. Do you have any comment?

   >
   >    “Media” is the content. Like a picture, video, etc. “Media outlet” is where it comes from, like social media (YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat) or even tv. 

   汪文斌：英方操弄所谓BNO护照新政策，一些受蛊惑的港人背井离乡，抵达英国后却沦为权益缺乏保障的“二等公民”。英方的目的究竟是“保护”港人，还是祸乱香港，相信大家都看得清清楚楚。

   中方已多次就BNO问题阐明立场，我们早已宣布不再承认所谓BNO护照作为有效旅行证件和身份证明。这一问题的来龙去脉十分清楚。英方抱持殖民旧梦，出尔反尔，粗暴干涉中国内政，严重违反国际法和国际关系基本准则，我们表示强烈不满和坚决反对。

   我们敦促英方停止插手香港事务，否则只会搬起石头砸自己的脚。

   Wang Wenbin: The UK side manipulated the so-called new BNO passport policy. Some Hong Kong residents were  induced  to leave their home, only  to become second-class UK “citizens” whose rights and interests are not fully  protected. I believe people are clear-eyed about whether the UK did so to “protect” people in Hong Kong or destabilize the SAR.  

   China has stated its position on the issue of BNO passports on many occasions. China announced long ago that it does not recognize BNO passports as valid travel or identity documents. The ins and outs of the problem are quite clear. The UK side, **clinging onto** its **nostalgic** colonial dream and breaking its promise, **grossly** interfered in China’s internal affairs and **gravely** violated international law and basic norms governing international relations. We express our strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to this.

   汪文斌：中国政府高度重视在乌中国公民安全状况，每时每刻牵挂着他们的安危。王毅国务委员兼外长日前在同乌克兰外长通话时强调，在乌的中国公民都是中乌友好的使者，都是乌克兰人民的朋友。我们赞赏乌方开设外国侨民撤离专列，这符合国际人道主义精神。希望乌方采取一切必要措施确保在乌中国公民安全，并继续为中国公民撤离提供保障和便利。

   借此机会，我愿介绍一些有关中国公民撤离乌克兰的相关情况。外交部正会同驻乌克兰使领馆评估形势，考虑各种因素和可能性，研究制定协助在乌中国公民自愿安全撤离的可行方案。目前已有超过3000名在乌中国公民安全转移到乌克兰周边国家，中方感谢有关国家为中国公民入境、短暂停留提供便利。

   Wang Wenbin: The Chinese government attaches great importance to the safety of Chinese citizens in Ukraine and **holds dear to heart** their safety all the time. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed in his phone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart that all Chinese citizens in Ukraine are **envoys** of China-Ukraine friendship and friends of the Ukrainian people. We appreciate the opening of special trains for the evacuation of foreign nationals by the Ukrainian side, which **conforms** to the **international humanitarian spirit**. We hope that the Ukrainian side will take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens in Ukraine and continue to provide guarantee and facilitation for the evacuation of Chinese citizens.

   I would also like to take this opportunity to share with you more information on the evacuation of Chinese citizens from Ukraine. The Foreign Ministry is working with the Chinese Embassy and Consulate General in Ukraine to assess the situation, consider various factors and possibilities, and formulate feasible plans to ensure the safe evacuation of Chinese citizens. So far, more than 3,000 Chinese citizens have been safely **relocated** to **neighboring countries** of Ukraine. China thanks relevant countries for facilitating Chinese citizens’ entry and temporary stay there.

   汪文斌：这个问题请你向北京冬奥组委询问。

   Wang Wenbin: I would like to point you to the Beijing Organising Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (BOCOG).

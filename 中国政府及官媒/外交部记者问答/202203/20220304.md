1. **总台央视记者：据报道，3日，美国不具名国防部高官称，中方持续表达对乌克兰局势关注，却不愿像其他国家一样谴责并制裁俄罗斯，无意参与任何形式的乌克兰问题外交解决方案。发言人对此有何评论？**

   CCTV: According to reports, an anonymous senior Pentagon official said on March 3 that China continues to express its concerns over what’s going on in Ukraine, but it is not willing to condemn or **sanction** Russia like other countries, and has shown no interest in becoming involved in any kind of diplomatic solution. What is your comment?

   > 1. sanction：**VERB**对…实施制裁;处罚**N-PLURAL**(对某国的)制裁

   汪文斌：近来，美方一再散布虚假信息，借乌克兰问题对中国进行污蔑抹黑。这种为了推卸自身责任而造谣的手法十分虚伪、卑劣。散布虚假信息掩盖不了美方自身的责任，反倒暴露了美方借危机渔利的真实意图。

   美方应当诚实交代：美国声称推动北约东扩是为了维护和平，美国做到了吗？美国声称要防止欧洲发生战争，美国做到了吗？美国声称致力于危机的和平解决，除了提供军事援助、加大军力威慑之外，美国做了哪些有利于和平的事呢？

   中方始终按照事情本身的是非曲直决定自己的立场和政策。我们欢迎一切有利于乌克兰问题政治解决的外交努力，支持俄乌双方通过对话谈判寻求照顾双方合理关切、有利于欧洲长治久安的政治解决之道。我们将继续为寻求和平、实现和平发挥建设性作用。

   Wang Wenbin: **For some time**, the US has been spreading **disinformation** and **smearing** China with the Ukraine issue. Fabricating rumors to **shirk** one’s own responsibility is very **hypocritical** and despicable. Spreading disinformation cannot help the US shift its responsibility. Instead, it only exposes its real motive of exploiting the crisis to its benefit.

   > 5. hypocritical[ˌhɪpə'krɪtɪkl]：**ADJ-GRADED**虚伪的;伪善的

   The US should give an honest account. It claimed to defend peace by working on NATO’s eastward expansion. Is peace achieved? It said it **were to** prevent war in Europe. Is war **averted**? It advertised its commitment to a peaceful settlement of the crisis. But from providing military aid to beefing up military **deterrence**, did it do anything good for peace?

   > 1. avert：**VERB**避免;阻止;防止
   > 2. deterrence[dɪ'terəns]：**N-UNCOUNT**（尤指对战争或犯罪的）威慑，吓阻，遏制

   China decides its own position and policy based on the merits of the matter itself. We welcome all diplomatic efforts that are **conducive** to the political settlement of the Ukraine issue, and support dialogue and negotiation by Russia and Ukraine for a political settlement that accommodates both sides’ **legitimate concerns** and is good for lasting stability and security in Europe. We will continue to play a constructive role in seeking and achieving peace.

   汪文斌：我注意到有关报道。中方高度重视核安全问题，对乌克兰境内核设施安全、安保形势严重关切。根据国际原子能机构从乌克兰核监管当局获取的信息，乌克兰相关核电站主要设备没有发现损坏，辐射本底没有变化。我们将继续密切关注形势发展，呼吁有关各方保持冷静克制，防止局势进一步升级，确保有关核设施的安全。

   Wang Wenbin: I noted relevant reports. China attaches great importance to nuclear safety and is gravely concerned about the safety and security situation of nuclear facilities in Ukraine. According to information obtained by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from the Ukrainian nuclear regulatory authorities, no damage has been found to essential equipment of the relevant Ukrainian nuclear power plant and the background radiation levels remain unchanged. We will continue to **closely monitor** the developments of the situation, and **call on** relevant parties to keep calm and **exercise restraint**, prevent further escalation of the situation and ensure the safety of relevant nuclear facilities.

3. **法新社记者：中方能否介绍撤离在乌克兰中国公民的最新情况？**

   AFP: Can you provide the latest information on the evacuation of Chinese citizens from Ukraine?

   汪文斌：连日来，中国驻乌**使领馆**一直在作出不懈努力，想方设法帮助中国公民安全撤离，目前有关工作正在有序推进。我们注意到俄乌双方均表示保障外国人安全撤离，希望双方采取一切必要措施，为中国公民撤离提供安全保障和便利。

   Wang Wenbin: **For days**, the **Chinese Embassy** and **Consulate General** in Ukraine have been making **relentless** efforts to **find ways for** Chinese citizens to evacuate safely. The relevant work is well underway **in an orderly fashion**. We have noted that both Ukraine and Russia said they will provide facilitation for the safe evacuation of foreign nationals. We hope the two sides can take all necessary measures to provide security assurances and convenience for Chinese citizens’ evacuation.

   RIA Novosti: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has said on Thursday that Japan’s to consider the possibility of significantly strengthening the country’s defense capability amid the current situation in Ukraine. **What is China’s comment on this**?

   汪文斌：日本在近代有过军国主义对外侵略的历史。因此，日本的军事安全动向一直备受亚洲邻国和国际社会关注。我们敦促日方深刻反省历史，汲取历史教训，尊重亚洲邻国安全关切，坚持走和平发展道路，多做有利于促进地区和平稳定的事。

   Wang Wenbin: Since the Japanese **militarism** launched foreign aggression in recent history, Japan’s moves in the military and security fields have been **followed closely** by its Asian neighbors and the international community. We urge the Japanese side to have a deep reflection on history, draw lessons from it, and respect its Asian neighbors’ security concerns, stay committed to peaceful development, and do more that is conducive to maintaining regional peace and stability.

   汪文斌：蓬佩奥是一个信誉破产的前政客，这种人的狂言妄语是不可能得逞的。

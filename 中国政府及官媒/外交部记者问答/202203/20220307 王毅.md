# 20220307 两会记者会

1. 对世界来说，今年又是一个充满挑战的年头。在当前重要时刻，各国需要的是团结而非分裂，是对话而非对抗。

   For the world, the year ahead continues to be full of challenges. At such a critical moment, countries need **solidarity**, not **division**; dialogue, not confrontation.

   > 1. solidarity


   作为负责任大国，中国将继续高举多边主义旗帜，同所有爱好和平、谋求发展的国家一道，加强团结合作，携手应对挑战，持续推动构建人类命运共同体，努力为世界开辟光明和美好的未来。

   As a responsible major country, China will continue to **hold high** the **banner** of **multilateralism**. We will work with all peace-loving and development-seeking countries to strengthen solidarity and cooperation, jointly meet challenges, and continue to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. We will strive together for a brighter and better future for the world.

   > 1. banner

2. 北京冬奥会让世界看到了一个更加自信、自强、开放、包容的中国。

   The Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 have presented to the world a more confident, **self-reliant**, open and **inclusive** China.

   > 1. self-reliant
   > 2. inclusive


   北京冬奥会的成功，不仅是中国的成功，也是世界的成功；不仅是体育的胜利，更是团结的胜利。

   Beijing 2022 is not only a success for China, but also a success for the world. It represents not just the triumph of sport but, more importantly, the triumph of solidarity.


   现在，各国运动员正在冬残奥会赛场上努力拼搏。冬奥期间汇聚起的团结与合作之光必将穿透阴霾和风雨，照亮人类携手前行的未来之路。

   As we speak, athletes from around the world are giving their best performance on the winter Paralympic field of play. I am confident that the light of unity and cooperation created by the Olympic and Paralympic Games will shine through the mist and rain, and illuminate the path for humanity to jointly **forge** ahead into the future.

   > 1. forge

3. 乌克兰局势发展到今天，原因错综复杂。解决复杂问题，需要的是冷静和理性，而不是火上浇油、激化矛盾。

   The situation in Ukraine has become what it is today for a variety of complex reasons. What is needed to solve complex issues is a cool head and a rational mind, not adding fuel to the fire which only **intensifies** the situation.

   > 1. intensify


   中方认为，要化解当前危机，必须坚持联合国宪章宗旨和原则，尊重和保障各国的主权和领土完整；必须坚持安全不可分割原则，照顾当事方的合理安全关切；必须坚持通过对话谈判，以和平方式解决争端；必须着眼地区长治久安，构建均衡、有效、可持续的欧洲安全机制。

   China believes that to resolve the current crisis, we must **uphold** the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and respect and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. We must adhere to the principle of indivisible security and accommodate the legitimate security concerns of the parties involved. We must settle disputes by peaceful means, through dialogue and negotiation. And we must keep in mind the long-term peace and stability of the region and put in place a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.

   > 1. uphold


   形势越紧，和谈越不能停止；分歧越大，越需要坐下来谈判。中方愿继续为劝和促谈发挥建设性作用，也愿在需要时与国际社会一道,开展必要的斡旋。

   China believes that the more tense the situation, the more important that the talks continue. The wider the disagreement, the greater the need to sit down and have negotiation. China is prepared to continue playing a constructive role to facilitate dialogue for peace and work alongside the international community when needed to carry out necessary mediation. 

4. 百年未有之大变局正在一幕幕向我们展开。

   Profound changes unseen in a century are **unfolding** before our eyes.


   正确的出路就是在多边主义旗帜下加强团结合作，携手推动构建人类命运共同体。

   The right way forward lies in greater solidarity and cooperation under the banner of multilateralism and joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.


   要秉持共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，摒弃独享安全、绝对安全的想法，坚持通过谈判停止冲突，通过对话解决争端，通过合作增进互信，共同建设持久和平的世界。

   Countries need to follow the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, reject the notion of exclusive or absolute security, and stay committed to ceasing conflicts through negotiation, resolving disputes through dialogue and increasing mutual trust through cooperation, to jointly build a world of enduring peace.


   世界因多样而精彩，差异不应成为对抗的理由。

   Diversity is what makes our world a beautiful place. Differences should not become a cause for confrontation.


   经济全球化是时代潮流，不以人的意志为转移，也不能被地缘竞争所割断。

   Economic globalization is the trend of the times, and like it or not, it is here to stay and not to be stopped by geopolitical competition.


   要反对各种形式的保护主义、孤立主义，坚定维护自由、公平、非歧视的多边贸易体制，拆掉小院高墙，共建开放市场。

   We must say no to all forms of protectionism and isolationism, and firmly uphold a free, fair and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system. We should tear down small yards with high fences and build open markets instead.


   面对全球性挑战，没有国家可以置身事外，也没有国家可以独善其身。必须同舟共济、共克时艰，在应对新冠疫情、恐怖主义、气候变化、网络安全等全球性问题上加强沟通协调，凝聚最大公约数，画出最大同心圆。 

   Faced with challenges of a global nature, no country can stay **aloof** or unaffected. We must **pull together** in these **trying** times, enhance communication and coordination on COVID-19, terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and other global issues, build maximum consensus, and pursue convergence of interests wherever possible.

   > 1. aloof
   > 2. pull together
   > 3. trying


   面对动荡变革的世界，中国始终代表着稳定性和正能量，始终站在历史前进的正确方向上。中方将继续胸怀天下、担当尽责，坚定不移地高举和平、发展、合作、共赢的旗帜，推动建设新型国际关系，推动构建人类命运共同体，同世界上一切进步力量一道，合力谋发展，一起向未来。

   In a world of instability and transformation, China always serves as an anchor for stability and a force for good, and always stands on the right side of history. We will continue to keep a global perspective, **honor our responsibilities**, and hold high the banner of peace, development and win-win cooperation, to promote the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. China will work with all progressive forces in the world for development and together for a shared future.

   > 1. honor

5. 中俄关系具有独立自主价值，建立在不结盟、不对抗、不针对第三方基础之上，更不受第三方的干扰和挑拨。这既是对历史经验的总结，也是对国际关系的创新。 

   The China-Russia relationship is valued for its independence. It is based on non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party, and it is free from interference or **discord** **sown** by third parties. This is both what historical experience has taught us and an innovation in international relations.

   > 1. discord
   > 2. sown


   中俄关系发展有着清晰的历史逻辑，具有强大的内生动力，两国人民的友谊坚如磐石，双方的合作前景广阔。不管国际风云如何险恶，中俄都将保持战略定力，将新时代全面战略协作伙伴关系不断推向前进。

   The China-Russia relationship is grounded in a clear logic of history and driven by strong internal dynamics, and the friendship between the Chinese and Russian peoples is rock-solid. There is a bright prospect for cooperation between the two sides. No matter how **precarious** and challenging the international situation may be, China and Russia will maintain strategic focus and steadily advance our comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.

   > 1. precarious

6. 我们并不是生活在一个和平的世界，但很幸运有一个和平的祖国。

   We don’t live in a peaceful world, but we are lucky to have a motherland that seeks and enjoys peace.


   外交为民永远在路上。我们愿继续用行动告诉每一位海外同胞，无论什么时刻、无论身处何方，你的身边有我们，你的背后是祖国！

   Serving the people is the **abiding** commitment of the Chinese diplomatic service. With everything we do, we will continue to show every one of our **compatriots** overseas that we stand with you at all times, wherever you may be, and your motherland will always **have your back**.

   > 1. abide
   > 2. compatriots

7. 美方不遗余力地对中国开展零和博弈式的“激烈竞争”，不断在涉及中方核心利益的问题上攻击挑事，接连在国际上拼凑打压中国的“小圈子”。这不是一个负责任大国应有的样子，也不是一个讲信誉国家所做的事情。中国作为一个主权独立国家，完全有权利采取必要措施坚定捍卫自身的正当权益。 

   The United States is **going to great lengths** to engage in intense, zero-sum competition with China, it keeps provoking China on issues concerning China’s core interests, and it is taking a string of actions to piece together small **blocs** to suppress China. This is not how a responsible power should act, or how a credible country does things. China is an independent sovereign country. We have every right to do what is necessary to firmly defend our legitimate interests.

   > 1. blocs


   大国竞争不是时代主题，零和博弈不是正确选择。在一个相互依存的全球化时代，中美两个大国如何找到正确相处之道，既是人类社会没有遇到过的课题，也是两国必须共同解开的方程式。 

   Major-country competition should not be **the order of the day** and **zero-sum game** is not the right choice. In a globalized and interdependent world, how China and the US find the right way forward and manage to get along is both a new question for humanity and a formulation that must be worked out by China and the US together.


   中美应当重拾融冰初心，重整行装出发，用相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢的“三原则”替代竞争、合作、对抗的“三分法”，推动美国对华政策重回理性务实的正轨，推动中美关系重回健康稳定的正道。  

   China and the US need to re-embrace the **conviction** that helped us break the ice 50 years ago, and set out on a new journey. We must replace the “competitive-collaborative-adversarial” **trichotomy** with the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, return the China policy of the US to the right track guided by reason and pragmatism, and to put China-US relations back on the right path of healthy and stable development.

   > 1. conviction
   > 2. trichotomy

8. 中欧关系不针对、不依附、也不受制于第三方。双方在相互尊重、互利共赢基础上开展对话合作，将为动荡的世界局势提供更多稳定因素。  

   The China-Europe relationship is not targeted at any third party, nor is it **subjugated** to or controlled by any third party. Dialogue and cooperation between the two sides on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit will add more stabilizing factors to an unstable world. 

   > 1. subjugate


   中欧合作历经几十年风雨，植根于坚实的民意基础、广泛的共同利益、相似的战略诉求，具有强大韧性和潜力，任何势力都不能也无法逆转。

   China-Europe cooperation, going through decades of ups and downs, is deeply rooted in solid public support, extensive common interests and similar strategic needs. Such cooperation enjoys great resilience and potential. It cannot be reversed by any force.


   中方始终从战略和长远角度看待中欧关系，中国的对欧政策保持稳定坚韧，不会因一时一事而改变。

   China views its relations with Europe from a strategic, long-term perspective. China’s policy toward Europe is firm and consistent. It will not be affected by any **turn** of events.

   > 1. turn

9. 尽管受到疫情等因素的冲击，但共建“一带一路”仍保持良好势头。“一带一路”基础设施的“硬联通”扎实推进，“一带一路”规则标准的“软联通”亮点纷呈，“一带一路”互帮互助的“心联通”持续深入。

   Despite the impact of the pandemic and other factors, Belt and Road cooperation has maintained a sound momentum. The “hard connectivity” of infrastructure made solid progress, the “institutional connectivity” of rules and standards yielded fruitful results, and the “people-to-people connectivity” featuring mutual help and assistance continued to deepen.


   共建“一带一路”的合作伙伴不断扩大，合作基础日益牢固，合作前景更加广阔，必将为后疫情时代的世界开辟新的发展前景。  

   Belt and Road cooperation is moving forward with more partners, stronger foundation and brighter prospects. It is sure to create new development opportunities to the post-COVID world.


   中方将同国际社会一道，继续推进高质量共建“一带一路”，努力实现更高合作水平、更高投入效益、更高供给质量、更高发展韧性，将“一带一路”打造成造福世界的“发展带”、惠及各国人民的“幸福路”。

   China will work with the international community to continue advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. We will aim for higher-level cooperation, better cost-effectiveness, higher-quality supply and stronger development resilience, to make the Belt and Road Initiative a “belt of development” to the benefit of the world and a “road to happiness” for people of all countries.

10. 美国的“印太战略”正在成为集团政治的代名词。美方打着促进地区合作的旗号，玩弄的却是地缘博弈的把戏；高喊要回归多边主义，实际上却在搞封闭排他的“俱乐部”；声称要维护国际规则，背地里却试图另搞一套自己的“帮规”。 

    The US Indo-Pacific strategy is becoming a byword for “bloc politics”. The US professes a desire to advance regional cooperation, but in reality it is stoking geopolitical rivalry. It talks a lot about returning to multilateralism, but in reality it is forming exclusive clubs. It claims to uphold international rules, but in reality it is setting and imposing rules that suit itself and its acolytes.


    从强化“五眼联盟”，到兜售“四边机制”、拼凑三边安全伙伴关系、收紧双边军事同盟，美国在亚太地区排出的“五四三二”阵势，带来的绝不是什么福音，而是搅乱地区和平稳定的祸水。 
    
    From strengthening the Five Eyes to peddling the Quad, from piecing together AUKUS to tightening bilateral military alliances, the US is staging a “five-four-three-two” formation in the Asia-Pacific. This is by no means some kind of blessing for the region, but a sinister move to disrupt regional peace and stability.


    “印太战略”的真正目的是企图搞印太版的“北约”，维护的是以美国为主导的霸权体系，冲击的是以东盟为中心的区域合作架构，损害的是地区国家的整体和长远利益。这股逆流与地区国家求和平、谋发展、促合作、图共赢的共同愿景背道而驰，注定是没有前途的。
    
    The real goal of the US Indo-Pacific strategy is to establish an Indo-Pacific version of NATO. It seeks to maintain the US-led system of hegemony, undermine the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture, and compromise the overall and long-term interests of countries in the region. The perverse actions run counter to the common aspiration of the region for peace, development, cooperation and win-win outcomes. They are doomed to fail. 


    亚太是合作发展的热土，而不是地缘政治的棋局。 
    
    The Asia-Pacific is a promising land for cooperation and development, not a chessboard for geopolitical contest.


    中国始终扎根亚太、建设亚太、造福亚太。对于符合地区实际、满足各方需要的倡议，我们都表示欢迎；对于挑拨地区对抗、制造阵营对立的主张，我们都坚决反对。
    
    With its root struck deep in the Asia-Pacific, China is committed to the region’s stability and prosperity. We welcome all initiatives that meet regional realities and the needs of relevant parties, and resolutely oppose all acts that lead to confrontation and rival camps in the region.


    中方愿同各方一道，明辨是非，坚守正道，抵制“印太”对抗“小圈子”、共筑亚太合作“大舞台”，携手迈向亚太命运共同体。
    
    China wants all parties to join us in doing the right thing and staying on the right course. Together, we will reject attempts to create small, divisive circles in the Indo-Pacific and, instead, foster a broad, inclusive platform for Asia-Pacific cooperation leading to an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future.

11. 全球发展倡议最核心的理念是以人民为中心，最重要的目标是助力落实联合国2030年可持续发展议程。

    The centerpiece of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) is to put people front and center. Its primary goal is to facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.


    可持续发展才是好发展，大家一起发展才是真发展。
    
    Good development is sustainable and true development is development for all.


    我们愿同各方一道，对接重点领域，对接各国需求，对接合作机制，对接各界伙伴，推动倡议逐步落地。
    
    China will work with all parties to implement the GDI step by step: forging synergy in priority areas, responding to the needs of all countries, partnering with cooperation mechanisms and reaching out to partners of all sectors.


    全球发展倡议是继“一带一路”之后，习近平主席提出的又一重大倡议，是对全球发展合作的“再动员”，是对以人民为中心这一核心人权理念的“再确认”，为缩小南北鸿沟、破解发展不平衡提出了“路线图”，也为推进联合国2030年可持续发展议程提供了“加速器”。
    
    The GDI is another major initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping after the Belt and Road Initiative. It is another clarion call to mobilize global development cooperation, and another endorsement of putting people front and center as a core concept of human rights. The GDI has drawn up a road map for narrowing the North-South gap and addressing development imbalance, and given a boost to the 2030 Agenda.

12. 30年来，中国和东盟顺天时、应地利、聚人和，走出了一条邻里相亲、合作共赢的光明大道，打造了最具活力和潜力的区域合作样板。

    Over the past three decades, China and ASEAN have embraced the trend of the times, enjoyed geographic proximity, and shared cultural affinity. We have found a broad path of good-neighborliness and win-win cooperation, and established a model of the most vibrant and promising regional cooperation.


    中国东盟关系没有最好，只会更好。
    
    China-ASEAN relations have no limits and are sure to grow even closer.


    中方愿同东盟国家一道，不忘维护稳定安宁的初心，秉持实现共同发展的使命，坚持互谅互让、互帮互助的邻里相处之道，推动双方关系像奔驰在中老铁路上的列车一样快速前行。
    
    Going forward, China will work with ASEAN countries to keep in mind our original aspiration of maintaining stability and tranquility, fulfill our shared mission of common development, and uphold the principle of mutual understanding, accommodation, help and support between good neighbors. China-ASEAN relations will speed ahead like trains on the China-Laos railway.


    中国东盟要做国际抗疫合作的倡导者、区域合作的引领者、亚太稳定的守护者。
    
    China and ASEAN must be forerunners in international cooperation against COVID-19, pacesetters in regional cooperation, and defenders of stability in the Asia-Pacific. 


    亚太地区不是大国博弈的“棋盘”，东盟国家不是地缘争夺的“棋子”，而是促进地区发展繁荣的重要“棋手”。
    
    The Asia-Pacific should not be a chessboard for major-power rivalry. ASEAN countries are not chess pieces in a geopolitical contest, but important chess players who will help promote regional development and prosperity.

13. 日方要不忘初心，把握好两国关系的正确方向，切实恪守中日四个政治文件原则和精神，践行“互为合作伙伴、互不构成威胁”“相互支持对方和平发展”的重要共识，确保两国关系始终沿着和平友好的方向发展。

    We hope that Japan will cherish the original aspiration and keep the bilateral relations on the right track. It is important to truly abide by the principles and spirit of the four China-Japan political documents, and implement such important common understandings as the two countries should “be partners, not threats” and “support each other’s peaceful development”. These are crucial for the bilateral relations to develop in the direction of peace and friendship.


    日方应顺势而为，而非逆流而动，不要为他人做火中取栗的事情，也不要走上以邻为壑的歧途。
    
    We hope that Japan will go along the trend instead of against it, decline to pull chestnuts out of the fire for others, and avoid pitting itself against its neighbors.

14. 海外同胞一时回不了家，我们就把家的温暖带到他们身边。

    If Chinese nationals abroad cannot come home for the time being, we bring the warmth of home to them.


    为民服务，为民解忧，是外交工作的应尽之责。
    
    Serving the people and addressing their concerns is a bounden duty of China’s diplomacy.


    中国外交将继续秉持以人民为中心的宗旨，做广大老百姓的贴心人，做海外同胞利益的守护人。
    
    We in the diplomatic service will continue to put people first and act as a ready provider of good service to the people and a defender of the interests of our compatriots overseas.


    今年我们将集中做好三件事：打造“智慧领事平台”，推出更多“指尖”上服务项目；构建“海外平安中国体系”，为海外同胞提供更有效、更及时的安全保障；推出“健康畅行计划”，助力安全、健康、便捷的跨国旅行。
    
    This year, we will focus our efforts in the following three areas: developing a platform for smart consular services and providing more services that can be easily accessed through mobile devices; building a system for the protection of Chinese nationals and interests overseas to provide more effective and timely safety and security support to our fellow Chinese abroad; and rolling out a plan to facilitate safe, healthy and convenient international travel.

15. 治病须治本，纠错要纠根。半岛问题的“根”，在于朝鲜面临的外部安全威胁长期得不到消除，朝方的合理安全关切始终没有得到解决。 

    As an old Chinese saying goes, “We must tend to the root cause when curing a disease or remedying a mistake.” The root cause for the issues on the Korean Peninsula is that the external security threats facing the DPRK have remained unresolved and its legitimate security concerns unaddressed for too long. 


    中韩之间不是对手，而是利益交融、优势互补、潜力巨大的合作伙伴。
    
    China and the ROK are not adversaries, but partners with converging interests, a lot to offer each other and much untapped cooperation potential.

16. 中方始终认为，一个发展、繁荣、稳定、充满活力的中亚符合中国和地区国家的共同利益。

    China always believes that a growing, prosperous, stable and dynamic Central Asia is in the common interest of China and other countries in the region.


    中方将继续本着相互尊重、睦邻友好、同舟共济、互利共赢四项原则，同中亚国家一起，合力构建内涵丰富、成果丰硕、友谊持久的战略伙伴关系，持续推进中国—中亚命运共同体建设。
    
    China will continue to follow the principles of mutual respect, good-neighborly friendship, solidarity in trying times and mutual benefit as it works with Central Asian countries to forge a strategic partnership featuring rich substance, fruitful results and enduring friendship and build a China-Central Asia community with a shared future.


    中国同中亚五国关系正处于三十而立的黄金岁月，呈现蓬勃发展的广阔前景。中方愿同五国一道，打造更加紧密的中国—中亚命运共同体，开创双方关系下一个更加精彩的30年。
    
    China’s relations with the five Central Asian countries, now at a golden age of 30, enjoy a bright prospect of vibrant growth. China will work with the five countries to build an even closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future and usher in yet another three decades of great achievements for China-Central Asia relations.

17. 美国公然以意识形态划线，在世界上制造分裂，这本身就是对民主精神的践踏。

    The US blatantly drew an ideological line between countries and created division in the world. The act violated the spirit of democracy.


    中国的全过程人民民主是广泛、真实、管用的民主，得到中国人民的衷心拥护和支持。
    
    China practices whole-process people’s democracy. It is broad-based, genuine and effective democracy which enjoys the wholehearted endorsement and support of the Chinese people.


    世界认可中国的民主，我们更对自己的道路充满信心。
    
    The world recognizes China’s democracy and we have full confidence in our path.


    人类文明的花园丰富多彩，各国的民主也应百花齐放。按照美国模式划定“民主标准”的作法恰恰是不民主的表现。打着“民主”的幌子干涉别国内政，只能使人民遭殃。唯我独尊不仅不是民主之义，而且还是民主之灾。
    
    Human civilization, if compared to a garden, should be a diverse place in which democracy in different countries blooms like a hundred flowers. Setting a standard for democracy after the US system is undemocratic. Meddling in other countries’ internal affairs in the name of democracy would only hurt the people in those countries. Putting one’s own system on a pedestal is not just against the spirit of democracy, but also spells disaster for democracy.


    中方期待同各国本着平等的态度交流互鉴，弘扬真正的民主精神，剥去各种伪民主面具，切实推进国际关系的民主化，促进人类进步事业不断前行。
    
    China looks forward to exchanges and mutual learning with other countries on the basis of equality. Let us promote the true spirit of democracy, strip pseudo-democracy of its various types of charade, and make international relations more democratic so as to inject forward momentum to human progress.

18. 台湾问题与乌克兰问题有着本质区别，没有任何可比性。

    The Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue are different in nature and are not comparable at all.


    有些人在乌克兰问题上强调主权原则，但在台湾问题上却不断损害中国的主权和领土完整，这是赤裸裸的双重标准。
    
    Some people, while being vocal about the principle of sovereignty on the Ukraine issue, have kept undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Taiwan question. This is a blatant act of double standards.


    台湾的前途希望在于两岸关系和平发展，在于实现国家的统一，而不是依靠什么外部的“空头支票”。“挟洋谋独”没有出路，“以台制华”注定失败，台湾终会回到祖国的怀抱。
    
    Taiwan’s future and hope lies in the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and reunification with the mainland, not in counting on the empty promises of external forces. Seeking foreign support to gain independence is a dead end. The scheme to use Taiwan to contain China is doomed to fail. Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland.

19. 我们将深化金砖合作，淬炼金砖“成色”，擦亮南南合作的“金字招牌”，为各国携手战胜疫情、推动世界经济复苏传递希望和信心。

    We will deepen BRICS cooperation across the board, make BRICS shine brighter, burnish BRICS credentials for South-South cooperation, and inspire hope and confidence for a joint effort by all countries to beat the pandemic and promote global recovery.


    我们将提出后疫情时代全球治理的“金砖主张”，筑牢抗击疫情的“金砖防线”，铺设加速全球发展的“金砖快线”，为构建全球发展伙伴关系作出“金砖贡献”。
    
    We will put forth BRICS proposals for improving global governance in the post-COVID era, cement BRICS defense against the COVID-19 pandemic, create a BRICS fast track for global development and make BRICS contributions to building a global development partnership.


    全球治理进入“亚洲时间”。 
    
    Asia’s time has come in global governance. 


    我们期待新兴市场和发展中国家从全球治理的“跟跑者”，向“并跑者”甚至“领跑者”转变，发挥更积极作用，发出更响亮声音。
    
    In the race of global governance, China looks forward to seeing emerging markets and developing countries turning from “followers” to “forerunners” and even “pacesetters”. Together, we can play a more active role and speak with a bigger voice.

20. 像中印这样拥有十几亿人口的大国，只有坚持独立自主，才能把命运牢牢掌握在自己手中，才能真正实现各自国家的发展振兴。

    For China and India, both major countries with a population of over a billion, only by staying independent can we firmly grasp our own destiny and realize our goals of development and rejuvenation.


    中印人口加起来超过28亿，占全球三分之一。中印实现稳定发展、和睦相处，世界的和平和繁荣就有了坚实基础。
    
    China and India have a combined population of over 2.8 billion and account for one third of humanity. When our two countries achieve stability and prosperity and live in peace and harmony, global peace and prosperity will have a solid foundation.


    希望印方同中方一道，坚守“互不构成威胁、互为发展机遇”的战略共识，坚持增进互信，避免误解误判，彼此作相互成就的伙伴，不当相互消耗的对手，确保两国关系沿着正确轨道前行。
    
    We hope that India will work with China to uphold the strategic consensus that our two countries “pose no threat but offer development opportunities to each other” and continue to build mutual trust and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation, so that we will be partners for mutual success instead of adversaries of mutual attrition. We must make sure that our relationship moves forward on the right track. 

21. 中国始终奉行“两个支持”，那就是支持中东国家团结协作解决地区安全问题，支持中东人民独立自主探索自身发展道路。

    China follows an approach of “double support”: to firmly support Middle Eastern countries in solving regional security issues through unity and coordination, and to firmly support people in the region in independently exploring their own development paths. 


    中国在中东发挥的始终是建设性作用，我们从不谋取什么地缘私利，更无意去填补所谓权力真空。
    
    China has always played a constructive role in the Middle East. We never intend to make geopolitical gains, still less to fill a so-called “power vacuum”. 


    应当把维护中东安全与发展的权力彻底交到中东人民手中。
    
    The power to protect security and development in the Middle East must be returned fully to the people in this region.

22. 对于南太平洋国家这样的小岛屿国家，我们一直有着一份特别的关注和支持。

    The small island countries in the South Pacific have always received special attention and support from China.


    中方愿同南太国家互尊互信、平等相待，支持南太国家坚定走符合自身国情的发展道路，互帮互助、共迎挑战，互学互鉴、合作共赢。
    
    China will continue to treat South Pacific countries as equals and with mutual respect and trust and support them in following development paths that suit their national conditions. We will continue to meet challenges together with South Pacific countries through mutual assistance. And we will continue to conduct mutual learning and win-win cooperation with South Pacific countries.


    中国始终是南太国家可以信赖的好朋友，愿共同打造不同大小、不同制度国家相互支持、团结合作的新典范。

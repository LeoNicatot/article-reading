1. 深圳卫视记者：近日美国在乌克兰的生物实验室引发广泛关注。据称美驻乌使馆已紧急删除涉及实验室的信息。中方对此有何评论？

   Shenzhen TV: Recently, US biological labs in Ukraine have drawn much attention. The US Embassy in Ukraine has reportedly removed information related to such labs in haste. Do you have any comment?

   赵立坚：近期美国在乌克兰的生物实验室确实引发各方高度关注。据报道，这些生物实验室内存储了大量危险病毒。俄罗斯还在军事行动中发现美国利用这些设施开展生物军事计划。
   Zhao Lijian: Lately US biological labs in Ukraine have indeed attracted much attention. According to reports, a large quantity of dangerous viruses are stored in these facilities. Russia has found during its military operations that the US uses these facilities to conduct bio-military plans.

   根据美方自己公布的数据，美国在乌克兰有26个生物实验室和其他相关设施。美国国防部拥有绝对控制权。乌境内所有的危险病毒都必须存储在这些实验室。所有的研究活动都由美方主导。未经美方许可，任何信息都不得公开。
   According to data released by the US, it has 26 bio-labs and other related facilities in Ukraine, over which the US Department of Defense has absolute control. All dangerous pathogens in Ukraine must be stored in these labs and all research activities are led by the US side. Without US approval, no information shall be released to the public.

   当前形势下，从乌克兰和周边地区乃至全世界人民的健康和安全出发，我们呼吁有关各方确保这些实验室的安全。尤其是美国作为最了解这些实验室的一方，应尽快公布相关具体情况，包括存储了哪些病毒、开展了哪些研究。
   Under current circumstances, for the sake of the health and safety of people in Ukraine, neighboring regions and beyond, we call on relevant sides to ensure the safety of these labs. The US, in particular, as the party that knows the labs the best, should disclose specific information as soon as possible, including which viruses are stored and what research has been conducted.

   美国在乌克兰的生物军事活动只是冰山一角。美国国防部以“合作减少生物安全风险”“加强全球公共卫生”等名义，在全球30个国家控制了336个生物实验室。336，你没有听错！美国在其境内的德特里克堡基地也开展了大量生物军事活动。

   I would also like to stress that, the biological military activities of the US in Ukraine are merely **the tip of the iceberg**. Using such **pretexts** as cooperating to reduce biological safety risks and strengthening global public health, the US has 336 biological labs in 30 countries under its control. 336, **you heard me right**. It also conducted many biological military activities at the Fort Detrick base at home.

   美国真正的意图是什么？具体干了什么？国际社会一直有疑虑。美国始终敷衍了事，甚至把国际社会提出质疑说成是“散布虚假信息”。不仅如此，20年来美国一直独家阻挠建立《禁止生物武器公约》核查机制，拒绝接受对其境内外生物设施的核查。这进一步加重了国际社会的关切。我们再次敦促美方对其境内外生物军事化活动作出全面澄清，并接受多边核查。

   What is the true intention of the US? What has it done specifically? The international community has long-held doubts. However, the US has kept stonewalling, and even dismissing the international community’s doubts as spreading disinformation. Besides, the US has been standing alone in obstructing the establishment of a Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) verification mechanism and refusing verification of its biological facilities at home and abroad for the past two decades. This has led to deeper concern of the international community. Once again we urge the US to give a full account of its biological military activities at home and abroad and subject itself to multilateral verification.

2. 法新社记者：昨天，王毅国务委员兼外长表示，中方愿为乌克兰和平提供斡旋帮助。能否具体解释一下这一表态的含义？中国是否向俄罗斯或乌克兰打出了这样的提议？
   AFP: Yesterday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China is open to help in the mediation for peace in Ukraine. Can you give any details on what this means? Has China reached out to Russia or Ukraine to make such an offer?
   赵立坚：我能告诉你的是，中方支持和鼓励一切有利于和平解决乌克兰危机的外交努力，愿继续为劝和促谈发挥建设性作用，也愿意在需要的时候同国际社会一道开展必要的斡旋。
   Zhao Lijian: I can tell you that China supports and encourages all diplomatic efforts conducive to peacefully resolving the Ukraine crisis. We are prepared to continue playing a constructive role to facilitate dialogue for peace and work alongside the international community when needed to carry out necessary mediation.

3. 总台央视记者：据报道，经过三年时间，特本克蒙中柬友谊医院正式建成启用。驻柬埔寨大使王文天同洪森首相共同出席启用仪式。发言人能否进一步介绍有关情况？
   CCTV: According to reports, the Tboung Khmum China-Cambodia Friendship Hospital has officially started operation after three years of construction. Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Wentian and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen presided over the inauguration ceremony. Could you offer more information?

   赵立坚：中国和柬埔寨是全面战略合作伙伴，双方正积极高质量构建“一带一路”。特本克蒙中柬友谊医院是中柬友好合作的又一重大成果，启用后将成为柬埔寨全国最大的省级医院，为柬北部五省民众提供优质医疗卫生服务，进一步丰富中柬命运共同体的内涵。中方将继续同柬方开展医疗卫生等领域合作，支持柬发展经济、改善民生。
   Zhao Lijian: China and Cambodia are comprehensive strategic cooperative partners working actively for the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.　As another major outcome of China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, the Tboung Khmum China-Cambodia Friendship Hospital is the largest provincial hospital in Cambodia and will provide quality medical and health services to people in the five northern provinces and further enrich the China-Cambodia community with a shared future. China will continue to conduct medical and health cooperation with Cambodia and support it in developing its economy and improving people’s livelihood.

4. 澎湃新闻记者：中国美国商会8日发布的2022年度《中国商业环境调查报告》显示，58%的美在华企业2021年营收实现增长。中国仍然是60%的企业近期全球投资计划的前三大投资目的地之一。66%的企业计划今年增加在华投资。83%的企业没有将制造或采购转移出中国的打算。中方对此有何评论？
   The Paper: The 2022 Business Climate Survey released by AmCham China on March 8 shows that 58% of respondents estimate higher revenue in 2021. China remains a top three priority investment destination for 60% of the member companies’ near term global investment plans. 66% of member companies plan to increase their investments in China in 2022. 83% of them do not consider relocating manufacturing or sourcing outside of China. Do you have any comment?
   赵立坚：中国美国商会发布的这份报告再次印证了外资企业对中国投资和营商环境的认同。这是对中国发展投下的“信任票”。展望未来，中国经济韧性强、潜力足、长期向好的基本面没有改变。中方将继续深化改革开放，打造市场化法治化国际化的营商环境。这将为包括美国企业在内的世界各国企业来华投资提供更多机遇。
   Zhao Lijian: The survey report released by the American Chamber of Commerce in the People’s Republic of China (AmCham China) is further endorsement by foreign businesses of China’s investment and business environment and a vote of confidence in China’s development. Looking ahead, the strong resilience, ample potential and fundamentals sustaining long-term growth of China’s economy remain unchanged. China will continue to deepen reform, expand opening-up, and foster a market-oriented international business environment with rule of law. This will provide more opportunities for foreign businesses including those from the US as they invest and operate in China.

   中美经贸关系的本质是互利共赢的。美国企业在华获取了丰厚利润，同时也为中国经济发展作出了贡献。我们也希望美国政府秉持开放包容、互利共赢的理念，停止对中国企业的无理设限和打压，为中美经贸合作健康发展营造有利条件。
   China-US economic and trade ties are mutually-beneficial and win-win in nature. While making huge profits in China, US companies also contribute to China’s economic development. It is our hope that the US government could embrace the vision of openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, stop unjustified restriction and suppression against Chinese enterprises, and create enabling conditions for the sound development of China-US economic and trade cooperation.

5. 《中国日报》记者：据了解，近期土耳其方面表示，由于希腊未能履行《洛桑条约》《巴黎和约》规定的东爱琴海非军事化义务，土方有权质疑希腊对有关岛屿的主权。土外长查武什奥卢表示将推动有关条约缔约方就岛屿主权问题进行讨论。中方对此有何评论？
   China Daily: As we have learned, the Turkish side recently said that due to Greece’s failure of fulfilling the demilitarization obligation in the eastern Aegean according to the Treaty of Lausanne and the Paris Peace Treaty, Turkey has the right to question Greece’s sovereignty over the islands concerned. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said he will facilitate discussions over the islands’ sovereignty with relevant parties to the treaties. What is China’s comment on this?
   赵立坚：中国始终主张尊重和维护各国主权和领土完整。东地中海地区紧张局势升级不符合任何一方利益。我们希望有关各方通过对话协商解决分歧，避免采取可能令紧张局势升级的行为，共同维护东地中海地区的和平稳定。
   Wang Wenbin: It is China’s consistent position that all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and defended. The escalation of tension in the eastern Mediterranean region serves no party’s interest. We hope parties concerned can resolve differences through dialogue and consultation, avoid making moves that may raise tension, and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean region.  

6. 彭博社记者：联合国方面称，已有170万人逃离乌克兰，另有400多名平民丧生。世界银行已批准向乌克兰提供7亿美元的援助计划。中方在俄罗斯是否入侵乌克兰问题上是否有新的立场？
   Bloomberg: The United Nations has said that 1.7 million people have fled Ukraine. They’ve also said more than 400 civilians have been killed. And the World Bank has approved a $700 million support package for Ukraine. Does China have any other position you’d like to put forward today on whether or not Russia actually invaded Ukraine?
   赵立坚：中方在乌克兰问题上的立场是明确和一贯的。昨天王毅国务委员兼外长在两会外长记者会上也充分阐明了相关立场。
   Zhao Lijian: China’s position on the Ukraine issue is clear and consistent. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi has fully elaborated on that at yesterday’s press conference on the sidelines of the two sessions.

7. 湖北广电记者：日前，德国联邦议院选择党党团主席魏德尔公开指出，西方强硬派固守过时的冷战思维，傲慢地否认俄罗斯大国地位，给乌克兰许下加入北约这一根本无法兑现的承诺，犯下灾难性的历史错误。制裁无法结束乌克兰的战事，各方需要的是现实、清醒地看待地缘政治，尽最大努力建立超越东西方阵营思维的欧洲安全机制。发言人对此有何评论？
   Hubei Media Group: Alice Weidel, co-leader of the German political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), said in public that the hardliners in the West who still live by the outdated logic of the Cold War have promised Ukraine the impossible membership in NATO, thus arrogantly denying Russia’s great power status. It is a historical failure. Sanctions will not be able to end the war in Ukraine. All parties should approach geopolitics with a realistic and cool-headed view and make all-out effort to create a European security architecture, but only without the "black-and-white thinking that we are the West and they are the East". Do you have any comment?
   赵立坚：这种看法很理性，她讲得也很精辟。事实上，早在1997年，美国前驻苏联大使乔治·凯南曾警告，北约继续东扩将是整个后冷战时代美国政策中最致命的错误。2014年，基辛格博士说过，乌克兰绝不能成为一方反对另一方的前哨，乌克兰加入北约是一条红线。2015年，美国教授米尔斯海默表示，美国在奉行门罗主义的同时，始终没有停止把乌克兰拉进西方阵营。俄罗斯作为大国，绝不会同意美西方这样做。近日，美国著名国际问题专家托马斯·弗里德曼刊文指出，在这场乌克兰危机中，美国和北约并非无辜的旁观者。美国关于北约东扩的政策给乌克兰危机这场冲突大火“添了一块巨大的木头”。令人遗憾的是，这些公正、客观、理性的分析未能形成美西方和北约现实版的政策。
   Zhao Lijian: This is a very rational and penetrating view. In fact, dating back to as early as 1997, George Kennan, former US ambassador to the Soviet Union, warned that expanding NATO up to Russia’s borders would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold-War era. In 2014, Dr. Kissinger said that Ukraine must not be either side’s outpost against the other, and Ukraine becoming a member of NATO would be a “red line”. US professor John Mearsheimer said in 2015 that while guided by the Monroe Doctrine, the US has never stopped its effort to drag Ukraine into the Western camp. Russia, as a great power, will never agree to such move by the US and the West. Thomas L. Friedman, a renowned American expert in international affairs, said in his recent article that America and NATO aren’t innocent bystanders in the Ukraine crisis. In his view, a “huge log” fueling this fire was the decision by the US to expand NATO eastward. Regrettably, these fair, objective and rational assessments have failed to be incorporated into the policy of the US, the West and NATO.

   中方始终认为，一国安全不能以损害他国安全为代价，地区安全不能以扩张军事集团来实现。乌克兰问题早已超越俄乌双边关系范畴。在北约连续五轮东扩情况下，俄罗斯在安全方面的正当诉求理应得到重视和妥善解决。正如王毅国务委员昨天所说，要化解危机，必须坚持联合国宪章宗旨和原则，尊重和保障各国的主权和领土完整；必须坚持安全不可分割原则，照顾当事方的合理安全关切；必须坚持通过对话谈判，以和平方式解决争端；必须着眼地区长治久安，构建均衡、有效、可持续的欧洲安全机制。中方将继续为劝和促谈发挥建设性作用，并愿在需要时与国际社会一道开展必要的斡旋。
   China always believes that the security of one country should not come at the expense of the security of other countries, still less should regional security be realized by expanding military blocs. The Ukraine issue has gone far beyond the bilateral scope of Russia-Ukraine relations. Given NATO’s five consecutive rounds of eastward expansion, Russia’s legitimate security demands ought to be taken seriously and properly addressed. Just as State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said yesterday, to resolve the current crisis, we must uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and respect and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. We must adhere to the principle of indivisible security and accommodate the legitimate concerns of the parties involved. We must settle disputes by peaceful means through dialogue and negotiation. And we must keep in mind the long-term peace and stability of the region and put in place a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture. China is prepared to continue playing a constructive role to facilitate dialogue for peace and work alongside the international community when needed to carry out necessary mediation.

8. 彭博社记者：越南外交部称，已要求中方不要通过军事演习侵犯其专属经济区和大陆架。这一言论显然是针对中方3月4日至15日期间在中国海南省和越南之间举行的军事演习所作的回应。外交部对此有何评论？
   Bloomberg: Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry said it has asked China not to violate its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf with military drills. The comments were apparently in response to Chinese military exercises taking place between Hainan and Vietnam from March 4 to March 15. Does China’s Foreign Ministry have a comment?
   赵立坚：中国在自己家门口开展军事演习活动合理合法，无可非议。
   Zhao Lijian: It is reasonable, lawful and irreproachable for China to conduct military exercises on its own doorstep.

今天是国际妇女节。毛泽东主席说过，妇女能顶半边天。因为有了半边天，世界变得温馨，家庭变得充满温情，生活变得多姿多彩。在此我祝愿所有的女同胞节日快乐！祝你们心中有梦，眼中有光，永葆青春，美丽开心！

Today is the International Women’s Day. As Chairman Mao Zedong said, women can hold up half the sky. Thanks to them, the world is a more loving place. They fill families with warmth and add brilliant colors to life. I would like to extend my best wishes to them on this special day. May you live your dream, stay young at heart, and glow with beauty, grace and happiness.

1. 总台央视记者：我们注意到，近期美国等个别国家称中国未采取切实措施化解冲突，也没有配合西方对俄制裁。还有美国智库称，中方的“平衡”策略毫无建设性。发言人对此有何评论？

   CCTV: We noted that certain countries, including the US, recently said that China has neither taken concrete measures to resolve conflicts nor followed the sanctioning of Russia by the West. A US think tank also called China’s “balancing” strategy nonconstructive. Do you have any comment?

   赵立坚：当你伸出手指指责别人的时候，不要忘了还有三根手指指向自己。那些指责中国在乌克兰问题上“袖手旁观”的人首先应该扪心自问，自己到底在这场危机中扮演了什么角色？到底是谁推动了北约连续五轮东扩？到底是谁连月来在乌克兰不断拱火浇油，渲染制造紧张氛围，最终导致局势失控升级？

   Zhao Lijian: Never forget that there are three fingers pointing back to you when you point fingers at others. Those who accused China of standing on the **sidelines** on the Ukraine issue should ask themselves these questions: What roles have they played in this crisis? Who pushed for NATO’s expansion eastward for five times? Who have fueled the situation in Ukraine and **hyped up** and escalated the tension for months and allowed it to spiral out of control?

   在乌克兰问题上，中方始终本着客观公正态度，根据事情本身的是非曲直，独立自主地作出判断，一直为劝和促谈发挥建设性作用。冲突发生第二天，习近平主席应约同普京总统通话时，就提出愿看到俄乌双方尽早和谈。前天，习近平主席同法国总统马克龙、德国总理朔尔茨举行视频峰会时再次强调，要共同支持俄乌和谈，推动双方维护谈判势头，克服困难谈下去，谈出结果、谈出和平。王毅国务委员兼外长近日连续同欧、美、俄、乌等多方通电话，提出关于乌克兰人道主义局势的“六点倡议”，为缓和局势、劝和促谈汇聚共识，提供助力。希望相关各方保持冷静克制，鼓励和支持一切有利于和平解决乌克兰危机的外交努力，共同推动局势降温。

   On the Ukraine issue, China has been independently making decisions **in the spirit of objectivity and fairness** and **based on the merits of the matter itself**. China has been playing a constructive part in facilitating dialogue for peace. On the second day of the conflict, President Xi Jinping spoke to President Vladimir Putin on the phone upon invitation and expressed China’s desire to see Russia and Ukraine **hold peace talks** as early as possible. The day before yesterday, President Xi had a virtual summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and **reiterated** that we need to jointly support the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and encourage the two sides to **keep the momentum of negotiations**, overcome difficulties, keep the talks going and bring about peaceful outcomes. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had phone calls with various parties in recent days including the EU, the US, Russia and Ukraine, and put forward a six-point **initiative** for the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, building consensus on and promoting efforts for deescalation of the situation and peace talks. We hope all relevant parities can remain cool-headed and exercise restraint, encourage and support all diplomatic efforts that are conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis and jointly cool down the situation.

   我要强调的是，挥舞制裁大棒无助于解决乌克兰问题。实践早已证明，制裁非但解决不了问题，还会制造出新的问题，不仅造成经济上“双输”或“多输”局面，还会干扰影响政治解决的进程，是真正的“毫无建设性”。美方在处理对俄关系时不得对中国企业和个人实施所谓制裁和长臂管辖，不得损害中方正当权益，否则中方将作出坚决有力回应。

   I want to stress that **wielding** the big stick of sanctions cannot solve the Ukraine issue. It has long been **proven** that rather than addressing the problem, sanctions will create new problems. Apart from economic loss on multiple sides, sanctions will disrupt the process of political settlement and are truly “nonconstructive”. When dealing with its relations with Russia, the US should not impose so-called sanctions and long-arm **jurisdiction** on Chinese companies and individuals or undermine the legitimate rights and interests of China, otherwise China will make strong and **resolute** response.

2. 总台央视记者：据报道，联合国叙利亚问题独立调查委员会重申，敦促美国等各方对在叙利亚空袭造成的平民伤亡进行可信、独立、公正的调查并追责。外交部对此有何评论？
   
   CCTV: It is reported that the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic reiterated the call on the United States and all parties to conduct credible, independent and impartial investigations into air strikes entailing civilian casualties in Syria and to ensure those responsible are held accountable. Do you have any comment?
   赵立坚：五年前，美军以“白头盔”组织摆拍视频的虚假情报为“证据”，对叙利亚展开所谓“史上最精确的空袭”造成1600多名无辜平民被炸身亡。

   Zhao Lijian: Five years ago, the US forces, using the fake intelligence of a staged video by “White Helmets” as evidence, conducted the so-called “most precise air campaign in history” in Syria, killing more than 1,600 innocent civilians.
   
国际社会要求对美国海外军事行动滥杀平民进行调查的呼声此起彼伏。单就叙利亚而言，2019年9月、2021年2月联合国叙利亚问题独立国际调查委员会在其报告中数度指出，美国在叙利亚发动的空袭没有区分军事目标和平民，严重违反国际人道法，涉嫌构成战争罪。但美国政府至今仍对此置若罔闻。
   
   The international community has been calling for investigations into the killing of civilians in the US’ overseas military operations. On Syria alone, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic pointed out several times in its reports in September 2019 and February 2021 that the US failed to distinguish military targets from civilians in its air strikes in Syria. This is a gravely violation of international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes. However, the US government has been turning a deaf ear to all this. 

   据报道，近二十年来，美国在阿富汗、伊拉克、叙利亚等国发动空袭超过9万次，在空袭中丧生的平民最高或达4.8万名。但美方一再地隐瞒、掩饰有关事实，拒不道歉、不认罪、不惩治凶手，千方百计逃避责任。对于美军在阿富汗一无人机空袭平民事件，美国国防部发言人去年12月公开承认，没有美军士兵会因此面临纪律处分。美国媒体去年底也披露，2014年至2019年，美军无人机多次袭击并杀害收割中的农民、街头嬉戏的儿童、逃避交战的家庭以及藏匿于楼房的村民。但这些灾难性的罪行被刻意掩盖、粉饰。
   
According to reports, over the past nearly two decades, the US conducted over 90,000 air strikes in countries including Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, which may have killed up to 48,000 civilians. But the US military time and again covered up the facts and refused to apologize, admit its crimes or hold the perpetrators accountable. It did everything possible to evade its responsibilities. On the drone attack of civilians in Afghanistan, a Pentagon spokesperson said openly in December 2021 that no US soldiers will face disciplinary action over it. The US media also disclosed at the end of last year that from 2014 to 2019, the US military turned its guns on farmers in the middle of harvest, children playing in the streets, families fleeing the fighting and villagers taking shelter in buildings. These disastrous crimes were deliberately concealed and whitewashed.
   
   美国媒体去年披露，根据美国军方内部对1300多份平民伤亡报告的机密评估，美国在中东多国发起的空袭中，平民死伤人数“被严重低估”。美国海军分析中心负责人刘易斯认为，“９.11”事件以来，美军导致的平民伤害事件几乎每周都会发生一次，而美国政府在平民伤害问题上一直都在玩忽职守。美方还阻挠国际刑事法院对其在阿富汗犯下的战争罪行进行调查。

   US media revealed last year that according to the US military’s own confidential assessments of more than 1,300 reports of civilian casualties, civilian casualties in US air strikes have been “significantly undercounted”. Larry Lewis, a director at the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) of the US, said that on average at least one incident of civilian harm has happened every week since 9/11. There has been an overall pattern of negligence with regard to the US government on the issue of civilian harm. The US has also obstructed the International Criminal Court’s investigations into its war crimes in Afghanistan. 
   
   每一个人的生命，不管其国家、种族、宗教、价值观有何不同，都是平等和宝贵的。美方应认真回应国际社会的强烈呼声，对美军空袭造成的平民伤亡进行可信、独立、公正的调查并切实追究相关人员责任。
   Every human life, regardless of nationality, race, religion or values, is equal and precious. The US should earnestly respond to the strong call of the international community, conduct a credible, independent and impartial investigation into civilian casualties caused by US air strikes, and hold those responsible accountable.
   
3. 韩联社记者：韩国国民力量党候选人尹锡悦当选新一任总统。请问中方对此有何评论？
   Yonhap News Agency: The candidate of the People Power Party Yoon Suk-yeol won the presidential election in the Republic of Korea. Do you have any comment?
   赵立坚：中方对尹锡悦先生当选韩国新一届总统表示祝贺。
   Zhao Lijian: China congratulates Mr. Yoon Suk-yeol on his election as the new president of the ROK. 

   中韩两国是搬不走的邻居，也是相互离不开的重要合作伙伴。今年是中韩建交30周年。30年来，中韩关系实现快速发展，给两国和两国人民带来实实在在利益，也为促进地区和平与发展作出积极贡献。我们愿同韩方共同努力，以建交30周年为契机，推动两国关系健康稳定发展，更好造福两国人民。

   China and the ROK are and will remain close neighbors. We are important cooperative partners that cannot do without the other. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the ROK. Over the past 30 years, China-ROK relations have witnessed rapid development, bringing tangible benefits to the two countries and two peoples and making positive contributions to regional peace and development. We stand ready to make joint efforts with the ROK to take the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties to promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations and bring more benefits to the two countries and peoples. 

4. 法新社记者：中方支持俄方有关美国在乌克兰举行生物军事活动的说法。美国白宫称这些言论是“虚假信息行动”，指责似乎也缺乏有力证据。中方基于什么消息源作出这些指责？你如何知道这并非只是重复俄方的宣传？
   AFP: China has supported Russia’s claims that the US conducted biological military activities in Ukraine. The White House calls these claims a disinformation operation and the allegations do appear to lack a strong evidence. So what are China’s sources for supporting these allegations? How do you know that you’re not simply repeating Russian propaganda?
   赵立坚：国际社会对于美国的生物军事活动早就有严重关切。美国在其境内的德特里克堡基地、在境外的336个生物实验室到底干了什么？是否符合《禁止生物武器公约》的规定？国际社会对此一无所知。这不是一两句话就能应付过去的。把国际社会的关切说成是虚假信息更不是一种负责任的态度。更令人困惑的是，如果美国确实遵守了《禁止生物武器公约》，为什么20年来美国独家反对建立多边核查机制？
   Zhao Lijian: The international community has had grave concerns about US bio-military activities for long. The world has no knowledge about what the US has been doing at Fort Detrick on its territory and the 336 biological labs overseas, or whether the activities conform to the stipulations of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). This is not something you can muddle through in a few words. It is even irresponsible to dismiss the concerns of the international community as “disinformation”. Why has the US been standing alone in opposing setting up multilateral verification mechanisms for 20 years if it has indeed complied with the BWC? Isn’t it confounding?

   美方既然提到了《禁止化学武器公约》，那么为什么不顺便告诉全世界，美国是迄今唯一一个仍然拥有化学武器的国家？国际社会一再要求美国尽快完成库存化学武器的销毁工作。但令人遗憾和关切的是，美国库存化学武器销毁工作已经两次逾期。
   Since the US mentioned the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) also, why doesn’t it tell the world handily that the US is the sole possessor state party of chemical weapons? The international community has been repeatedly asking the US to complete the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpiles as soon as possible. However, it is regrettable and concerning that the US has twice missed the deadline for destruction.

   中方一贯坚决反对任何国家在任何情况下研发、拥有或使用生物武器和化学武器。当前形势下，我们呼吁有关各方从乌克兰和周边地区乃至全世界人民的健康和安全出发，确保相关实验室的安全。我们也再次敦促美国切实履行国际义务，对其境内外生物军事活动作出全面澄清并接受多边核查，同时尽快完成其库存化学武器的销毁工作。
   China firmly opposes any country’s research and development, possession or use of biological weapons and chemical weapons under any circumstances. Under the current circumstances, we call on all relevant parities to keep in mind people’s health and safety in Ukraine, the neighboring areas and the whole world, and ensure the security of the relevant labs. We once again urge the US to earnestly fulfill its international obligations, give a clear account of its bio-military activities both at home and abroad and accept multilateral verification, and complete the destruction of its chemical weapons arsenal as soon as possible.

   至于你说的我提到的有关数字的来源是哪里，我前天提到这些数字的时候，已经明确说了。这都是美方自己公布的数字。
   You asked about the source of the figures I mentioned. When I mentioned these figures the day before yesterday, I made it clear that they were released by the US side.

5. 土耳其广播电视台记者：俄罗斯和乌克兰外长今天在土耳其会晤，这是自战争爆发以来，俄乌双方首次会面。土耳其外长表示他也将出席会谈。你对此次外长会有何评论和期待？
   TRT: The foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine are meeting today first time since the war began. They are meeting in Turkey and Turkish foreign minister said he will be present at the meeting. So what is your comment and expectations for the ministers’ meeting today in Turkey?
   赵立坚：昨天我已经就有关问题表明了立场。中方欢迎一切致力于和平解决乌克兰危机的外交努力，包括土耳其、俄罗斯、乌克兰三方外长会晤。我们注意到这是俄乌冲突以来双方级别最高的一次会晤。我们希望有关各方本着相互尊重的原则相向而行，坐下来认真谈判，为和平解决危机作出积极努力。
   Zhao Lijian: Yesterday, I made clear my position on relevant issues. China welcomes all diplomatic efforts to peacefully resolve the Ukraine crisis, including the trilateral foreign ministers’ meeting of Turkey, Russia and Ukraine. We note that this is the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the conflict broke out between Russia and Ukraine. We hope relevant parties can meet each other halfway in the principle of mutual respect, sit down for serious negotiations and make positive efforts for a peaceful settlement of the crisis.

6. 《北京青年报》记者：3月9日，第157届阿拉伯国家联盟外长理事会会议通过决议，赞赏中方为支持阿拉伯事业、和平解决地区危机所做外交努力，欢迎沙特于2022年主办首届阿中峰会，强调愿在“一带一路”倡议下加强同中国各领域合作。中方对此有何评论？
   Beijing Youth Daily: The 157th session of the League of Arab States Council at the level of foreign ministers adopted a resolution on March 9, which expressed appreciation for China’s diplomatic efforts in supporting the Arab cause and peaceful settlement of regional crises and welcome for Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the first Arab-China summit in 2022, and stressed readiness to strengthen cooperation with China in various sectors under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Do you have any comment?
   赵立坚：中方高度赞赏阿盟外长理事会连续多年通过加强对华关系的决议。本届外长理事会再次高度赞赏中方和平解决地区危机所做外交努力，充分体现了双方战略伙伴关系的高水平，也反映出中阿双方在解决地区问题方面的广泛共识。
   Zhao Lijian: We highly appreciate the resolutions adopted by the League of Arab States Council at the level of foreign ministers on strengthening relations with China for many consecutive years. This year’s session once again expressed high appreciation for China’s diplomatic efforts in supporting peaceful resolution of regional crises. It clearly embodies the high level of China-Arab strategic partnership and reflects the broad consensus of China and the Arab states on addressing regional issues.

   正如王毅国务委员在两会记者会上所说，中国在中东地区从不谋求什么地缘私利，更无意去填补所谓权力真空。中东是中东人的中东，应当把维护中东安全与发展的权利彻底交到中东人民手中。中国始终奉行“两个支持”，那就是支持中东国家团结协作解决地区安全问题，支持中东人民独立自主探索自身发展道路。
   Just as State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at the press conference during the two sessions, China never intends to make geopolitical gains in the Middle East, still less to fill a so-called “power vacuum”. The Middle East belongs to the people of this land. The power to protect security and development in the Middle East must be returned fully to the people in this region. China follows an approach of “double support”: to firmly support Middle Eastern countries in solving regional security issues through unity and coordination, and to firmly support people in the region in independently exploring their own development paths.

   面对疫情，中阿关系逆势前行，继续焕发出生机与活力。去年，中国继续稳居阿拉伯国家第一大贸易伙伴国，双边贸易额约3300亿美元，同比增长约37%。中阿“一带一路”重点项目有序推进，5G、人工智能、航空航天等高新技术合作方兴未艾，务实合作迈上了新台阶。下阶段，中方将同阿方一道，共同筹备好首届中阿峰会，为中阿战略伙伴关系注入更多新内涵，携手打造面向新时代的中阿命运共同体。
   Amid COVID-19, China-Arab relations have continued to flourish with vitality against all odds. Last year, China remained Arab states’ largest trading partner with two-way trade standing around $330 billion, a year-on-year increase of about 37 percent. Key BRI projects between the two sides have made steady progress. Cooperation in new and high tech sectors such as 5G, AI, space and aviation is burgeoning. Practical cooperation has reached a new height. Going forward, China will continue to work together with the Arab side to prepare for the first China-Arab summit, enrich the China-Arab strategic partnership with new dimensions, and jointly forge a China-Arab community with a shared future for the new era.

7. 日本读卖新闻记者：近日，俄罗斯发布了一份不友好国家和地区的名单。中方如何评论？如果将来俄罗斯采取具体行动，中方如何回应？
   Yomiuri Shimbun: Russia has published a list of unfriendly countries and regions. Do you have any comment? If Russia takes concrete actions in the future, how will China respond?
   赵立坚：俄罗斯作为主权国家，有权作出自己的决定。
   Zhao Lijian: Russia as a sovereign state has the right to make its own decisions.

8. 凤凰卫视记者：我们注意到，东盟轮值主席国柬埔寨外交大臣表示，因为部分东盟国家领导人不能按时出席，原定于本月28日举行的美国—东盟领导人峰会将推迟，会期将另外选择。还有评论指出，白宫此前单方面宣布会议日期让东盟一些国家颇为不悦。在此之前，东盟国家领导人也提议了几个日期，但是被美方一改再改。如果按照美方单方面提出的日期，将有一半的东盟国家领导人无法出席。中方对此有何评论？
   Phoenix TV: We noticed that the foreign minister of Cambodia, which currently holds the rotating chair position of ASEAN, said the ASEAN-US summit scheduled to be held on March 28 has been postponed to a later date because some ASEAN leaders cannot attend the meeting on the proposed date. Some people commented that the White House’s unilateral announcement of the dates has displeased some ASEAN countries. The dates proposed by ASEAN leaders before had been modified by the US for multiple times. If the meeting is held on the dates decided by the US, then half of the ASEAN leaders cannot make it. What is China’s comment?
   赵立坚：我们注意到有关报道。中方希望美方在参与东亚区域合作时，能够本着相互尊重的精神，以实际行动支持东盟中心地位，多做有利于促进地区和平、稳定和繁荣的事。
   Zhao Lijian: We noted relevant reports. China hopes that when participating in regional cooperation in East Asia, the US can follow the spirit of mutual respect, support ASEAN centrality with real actions and do more things that promote regional peace, stability and prosperity.

9. 韩国文化广播公司记者：请问中国政府同韩国当选总统有联系吗？
   MBC: Is there any contact between the Chinese government and the ROK president-elect?
   赵立坚：我们当然有联系。如果有进一步的消息，中方会及时发布。
   Zhao Lijian: Of course we have contact. If we have further information, we will release it in a timely manner.

10. 法新社记者：中方已同意向乌克兰提供大约80万美元的人道主义援助。中国是否计划未来提供更多援助？
    AFP: China has agreed to send Ukraine about $800,000 in humanitarian aid. Does it have plans to send more in the future?
    赵立坚：我昨天就中国向乌克兰提供人道主义援助发布了有关消息。中方还会根据乌克兰的需求提供进一步人道主义援助。
    Zhao Lijian: Yesterday, I released relevant information on China’s humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. China will provide further humanitarian assistance according to Ukraine’s needs.

11. 路透社记者：中方称乌克兰境内的生物实验室被美方控制。而我们的消息源称，事实上这些实验室只是接受美方的资助，并受到乌克兰政府的控制。中方有何证据证明美国控制着生物实验室？美国国防部和白宫发言人昨天都驳斥了俄罗斯和中国有关这些实验室的说法，国防部发言人称这些说法可笑，白宫发言人普萨基称说法不实。外交部有何评论？
    Reuters: China has said that the bio-labs in Ukraine are controlled by the US but sources we’ve spoken to say that, in fact, these are just labs that have received funding from the US and are in control of Ukrainian authorities. So I want to ask, what proof does China have that the US is in control of these bio-labs? Both the Pentagon spokesperson and the White House spokesperson yesterday refuted the claims made by both Russia and China regarding these bio-labs. I think the Pentagon spokesman said that the claims were laughable whilst the White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that they were simply false. So I was wondering if we could get a Chinese foreign ministry comment on this. 
    赵立坚：我刚才已经说的非常详细了。前天我也就有关问题做了非常详细的说明。
    Zhao Lijian: I just shared many details with you. In fact, I also elaborated on this question the day before yesterday. 

    美国在境内德特里克堡基地、在境外336个生物实验室，他们到底干了什么？符不符合《禁止生物武器公约》的规定？国际社会对此所知甚少。这次美方在乌克兰有关实验室的秘密被揭开，不是一句两句话可以搪塞过去的，也不是他们说俄罗斯的发现和中方表态是所谓宣传、荒谬可笑就可以应付过去的。美国应该正视国际社会的关切，全面澄清在境内外有关生物军事基地的所有信息。
    What has the US been doing at Fort Detrick and its 336 biological laboratories abroad? Do the activities conform to the stipulations of the BWC? Little is known to the international community. The revelation of the secrets of relevant US laboratories in Ukraine cannot be brushed off with just one or two words. And calling China’s statement and Russia’s finding “propaganda” and “laughable” cannot help the US get away. The US should face squarely the concerns of the international community, and five a full account of all the information about its overseas bio-military sites.

    我们也要求美国接受多边核查，尽快履行应尽义务，销毁其库存化学武器。
    We also ask the US to accept multilateral verification, fulfill its due obligations and complete the destruction of its chemical weapons arsenal as soon as possible.

12. 路透社记者：中国政府组织的撤离在乌公民的包机是否免费？还是每位中国公民只有付费才能登机？如果不免费，每张机票价格多少？
    Reuters: We were wondering whether the charter flights organized by the Chinese government to evacuate Chinese nationals in Ukraine were free or whether each Chinese national had to pay a fee in order to get on these flights? If they were not free, then could we ask how much each ticket costs?
    赵立坚：我可以告诉你的是，经过各方共同努力，在乌克兰的绝大多数中国公民已经安全撤离至周边邻国，并在中国驻当地使馆精心安排下得到妥善安置。考虑到大部分同胞甫经战乱、希望尽快回国的强烈愿望，国内各部门、各地方密切协调，迅速派出多架包机，从欧洲陆续接回离乌公民。截至目前，已有九架接返自乌克兰撤离中国公民临时航班安全抵达中国。
    Zhao Lijian: I can tell you that with the concerted efforts of all parties, the vast majority of Chinese citizens in Ukraine have been safely evacuated to neighboring countries and taken care of with the thoughtful arrangements of the Chinese embassies there. Taking into account the strong desire of most of our compatriots to return home as soon as possible after experiencing the fighting, various departments and localities in China coordinated closely and promptly sent a number of charter flights to bring back from Europe Chinese citizens who have evacuated from Ukraine. So far, nine charter flights carrying Chinese nationals evacuated from Ukraine have safely arrived in China.

    近年来，中国政府多次派出临时航班，从世界各地包括一些高风险甚至战乱地区接回确有困难、自愿回国的中国公民，已经形成一套科学高效、可持续的制度化安排。这其中，政府部门统筹协调，有关航空公司合理确定价格。今后，我们将根据形势发展，在实践中不断完善相关做法。
    In recent years, the Chinese government has sent temporary flights many times to bring back from risk-prone or even war-torn areas Chinese citizens who want to return home but have difficulties in doing so. A set of institutionalized arrangements has been formed, including coordination by government departments and lowest possible pricing by relevant airlines. In the future, we will continue to improve relevant practices in accordance with the development of the situation.

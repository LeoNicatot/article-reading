**应国务委员兼外长王毅邀请，阿尔及利亚外长拉马拉、坦桑尼亚外长穆拉穆拉、赞比亚外长卡库博将于3月18日至21日对中国进行访问。**

At the invitation of **State Councilor** and **Foreign Minister** Wang Yi, Foreign Minister of Algeria Ramtane Lamamra, Foreign Minister of Tanzania Liberata Mulamula and Foreign Minister of Zambia Stanley Kakubo will visit China from March 18 to 21.

1. **湖北广播电视台记者：据报道，日本首相岸田文雄在16日举行的记者会上就俄乌冲突表示，国际社会必须保持团结。日方也将要求中国采取负责任的行动。此外，俄乌冲突发生后，日本政府已宣布多项对俄制裁措施。岸田首相称南千岛群岛是“日本固有领土”，“被俄罗斯非法占据”。日本考虑通过修改《国家安保战略》，全面强化日防卫力量。中方对此有何评论？**

   Hubei Media Group: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said at a press conference on March 16 that the international community must stand in solidarity and Japan “calls on China to take responsible action” on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Besides, the Japanese government has announced multiple sanctions on Russia after the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out. The Prime Minister called the southern Kuril Islands Japan’s inherent territory which is illegally occupied by Russia, and said Japan considers revising its National Security Strategy to comprehensively strengthen Japan’s defense capability. What is China’s comment? 

   **赵立坚：在乌克兰问题上，中方一直致力于劝和促谈，为化解当前危机提出中方倡议，为推动局势降温作出积极努力。中方的立场是客观、公正和建设性的，无可非议。**

   Zhao Lijian: On the Ukraine issue, China has been making positive efforts to deescalate the situation as we are committed to promoting peace talks and proposing our initiative to resolve the current crisis. Our position is objective, fair, constructive and beyond **reproach**.

   > 1. reproach：**N-VAR**责备;斥责;指责;责怪

   **由于近代日本军国主义有过对外侵略历史，日本的军事安全动向一直备受亚洲邻国的关注。我们注意到，近期日本国内一些政治势力在乌克兰问题上借题发挥，刻意渲染外部威胁，企图浑水摸鱼搞强军扩武。我们要正告日方，世界反法西斯战争胜利成果应切实得到尊重和遵守。日方应深刻反省历史，汲取历史教训，尊重亚洲邻国安全关切，坚持走和平发展道路，多做有利于促进地区和平稳定的事，而不是相反。**

   Due to the aggression of Japan’s militarism in modern history, Japan’s moves in the military and security fields have always been followed closely by its Asian neighbors. We have noted that some political forces in Japan have been using the Ukraine issue as a **pretext** recently to deliberately **play up** external threats and seek stronger military forces and capability. A **stern** warning to Japan: The victorious outcomes of the World Anti-Fascist War should be earnestly respected and **upheld**. The Japanese side should deeply reflect on history, **draw lessons from the past**, respect the security concerns of its Asian neighbors, stay committed to peaceful development, and do more things that benefit regional peace and stability instead of the opposite.

2. **法新社记者：还是关于乌克兰危机的问题。越来越多的证据显示，俄罗斯对平民目标展开了数次袭击。据悉，昨天俄军袭击了马里乌波尔的一座剧院，当时有数百名平民藏身于剧院内，门口的地面上用俄语清楚写着“儿童”，但俄军还是袭击了该剧院。目前还不清楚造成的平民伤亡数字。中方迄未明确反对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰。我们能否认为中方可以接受这种不加区分的杀戮平民行为？美国总统拜登称普京总统为战争罪犯。中方是否也认为俄方可能在乌克兰犯下战争罪？**

   AFP: Staying with the Ukraine crisis, there’s **mounting** evidence now of several Russian attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine. Yesterday, Russian forces are believed to have attacked a theater in the city of Mariupol. Hundreds of civilians were thought to be sheltering inside at the time, and the Russian word for “children” was clearly painted on the ground outside. And yet they still attacked, killing an unknown number of civilians. My question is given that China has not explicitly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, should we assume that China therefore **has no problem with** this kind of **indiscriminate** killing of civilians? President Biden has called President Putin a “war criminal”. Does China agree that Russia may have committed war crimes in Ukraine?

   > 1. mount：**VERB**增多;增加
   >
   >    注意到evidence是不可数的
   >
   > 2. indiscriminate[ˌɪndɪˈskrɪmɪnət]：**ADJ-GRADED**不加区别的;不加选择的

   **赵立坚：在乌克兰问题上，中方一直大声疾呼国际社会聚焦劝和促谈和防止大规模人道主义危机两件事，并为此付出大量努力。中方已就缓解乌克兰人道局势提出六点倡议，并采取了实际行动。中方今后还将根据需要继续提供新的人道主义援助。**

   Zhao Lijian: On the Ukraine issue, China has made its view known that the international community should focus on two things, namely, peace talks and avoidance of a large-scale humanitarian crisis. We have also made huge efforts in this regard. China has proposed a six-point initiative on easing the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and has taken real actions. We will continue to provide new humanitarian assistance as needed. 

   **我想强调的是，中方对于和谈的立场是一贯的。你可以查阅中方在有关伊拉克、叙利亚、阿富汗、巴以等热点问题上的历次表态。**

   I want to stress that China’s position on peace talks is consistent. You may refer to China’s statements on hotspot issues including Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and **Palestine** and Israel. 

   > 1. Palestine[ˈpæləstaɪn]：巴勒斯坦

   **关于平民伤亡和人道主义局势，我想问的是，当初你们也是同样如此关心伊拉克、叙利亚、阿富汗和巴勒斯坦人民的伤亡吗？他们这些平民对你们来说毫无意义吗？我还忘了提1999年的塞尔维亚，也就是南联盟。他们的平民伤亡你们就毫不在意吗？如果是，恐怕你们毫无资格对中方进行指责。**

   When it comes to civilian casualties and humanitarian situation, I wonder if you were equally concerned about the civilian casualties in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Palestine. Do these civilians mean nothing to you? Do not forget Serbia in 1999, or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Did you show any care about civilian casualties there? If not, then you are in no position to make accusations against China.

   > 这里的逻辑是这样的：你们没有公正地关注这些问题，那你们没有资格指责中方；但是没有回答中方这样的做法是否符合国际法等；
   >
   > 我觉得：在这个问题上，由于中国与俄罗斯利益关系过于紧密，以及两者之间是唇亡齿寒的关系，故中方只能促进和谈，别无选择；

   **中方的立场光明磊落、客观公正，而美国、北约的立场，包括某些西方媒体的立场显然是虚伪的。特别是联想到有些西方媒体报道中流露出的种族主义倾向，我们建议有些媒体还是将精力和重点放到真正有利于促进和平的事情上。你们应该建议美国和北约不要再运输弹药，不要去火上浇油，而是坐下来和欧洲一道、和俄罗斯一道、和乌克兰一道去对话谈判，谈出和平。**

   China’s position is **aboveboard**, objective and **just**. But the US, NATO and some western media are very hypocritical, especially as some reports **smack** of racism. We suggest some media focus more efforts on things that are conducive to promoting peace. They may advise the US and NATO countries not to supply **ammunition** or add fuel to the flame, but to sit down and build peace by talking with Europe, Russia and Ukraine.

   > 1. aboveboard
   > 2. just
   > 3. smack
   > 4. ammunition

3. **凤凰卫视记者：中方一直强调在俄乌冲突中保持中立，但有评论认为随着局势发展，中方立场越来越“不舒服”，陷入尴尬。你对此有何回应？**

   Phoenix TV: China has always emphasized its **impartiality** in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But there are comments that China’s position is becoming increasingly “uncomfortable” and “awkward” as the situation develops. What is your response to this?

   > 1. impartiality

   **赵立坚：我们已多次就乌克兰问题阐述中方立场。中方立场的确同少数国家不同。中方立场光明磊落、公正客观、无可非议。**

   Zhao Lijian: I have **elaborated** on China’s position on the Ukraine issue many times. Unlike that of a few countries, China’s position is aboveboard, objective, fair and beyond reproach.

   > 1. elaborate

   **说到“不舒服”，真正感到不舒服的，是那些自以为赢得冷战、可以独霸天下的国家，是那些无视他国关切、持续五轮推进北约东扩的国家，是那些四处对外发动战争却又指责别国好战的国家。我听说，连俄罗斯的猫、俄罗斯的狗、俄罗斯的树都要被制裁。我还听说，柴可夫斯基的《天鹅湖》也被禁演。柴可夫斯基是著名作曲家，已经去世一百多年，他又何罪之有呢？《天鹅湖》是世界舞蹈艺术佳作，它又何罪之有呢？**

   Speaking of “uncomfortable”, it is those countries that **delude** themselves into thinking that they can **lord** it over the world after winning the Cold War, those that keep driving NATO’s eastward expansion five times in disregard of other countries’ security concerns, and those that wage wars across the globe while accusing other countries of being **belligerent**, that should really feel “uncomfortable”. I learned that cats, dogs and trees in Russia will be sanctioned. I also heard that Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake is **axed**. But Tchaikovsky was a famous composer, who died over 100 years ago. What faults can be found with him or his Swan Lake, a timeless masterpiece of ballet?

   > 1. delude
   > 2. lord
   > 3. belligerent
   > 4. axed

4. **新华社记者：能否介绍阿尔及利亚、坦桑尼亚、赞比亚三国外长访华的有关安排和中方期待？中方如何看待同这三个国家的关系？**

   Xinhua News Agency: Could you share with us the arrangement for Algerian, Tanzanian and Zambian foreign ministers’ visit to China and China’s expectations? How does China see the relations with these three countries? 

   **赵立坚：我刚才发布了阿尔及利亚、坦桑尼亚、赞比亚三国外长将访华的消息。**

   Zhao Lijian: I just released the information on the visits by Algerian, Tanzanian and Zambian foreign ministers.

   **中国和阿尔及利亚友谊深厚。阿尔及利亚是首个同中国建立全面战略伙伴关系的阿拉伯国家。近年来，在两国元首战略指引下，中阿关系全面、深入发展，双方在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上坚定相互支持，积极共建“一带一路”，各领域务实合作成果丰硕，在抗击新冠肺炎疫情中守望相助，在国际和地区事务中保持密切沟通与协调。中方高度重视中阿关系发展，愿同阿方一道，推动中阿全面战略伙伴关系迈上新台阶。**

   China and Algeria enjoy deep friendship. Algeria is the first Arab country that established comprehensive strategic partnership with China. In recent years, under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, China-Algeria relations have experienced comprehensive and profound development. The two sides have supported each other firmly on issues related to each other’s core interests and major concerns, actively promoted Belt and Road cooperation, and achieved fruitful outcomes in practical cooperation in various areas. The two countries have stood together in combating COVID-19, and maintained close communication and coordination on international and regional affairs. China attaches great importance to developing China-Algeria relations, and stands ready to jointly elevate China-Algeria comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level.

   **坦桑尼亚外长穆拉穆拉是就任后首次访华。中国和坦桑尼亚是传统友好国家和全面战略伙伴。两国传统友谊由双方老一辈领导人缔造并传承至今。在中坦两国元首引领下，两国关系发展迅速，政治互信不断提升，各领域务实合作蓬勃发展，在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上坚定相互支持，在国际和地区事务中保持密切沟通协调。中方始终从战略高度和长远角度看待和发展中坦关系，愿同坦桑尼亚加强共建“一带一路”合作，对接落实中非合作论坛“九项工程”，推动双方合作取得更多新成果。**

   The upcoming visit will be Foreign Minister of Tanzania Liberata Mulamula’s first visit to China since she took office. China and Tanzania are comprehensive strategic partners with long-standing friendship. Our traditional friendship, forged by the older generation of leaders on both sides, is passed on to this day. Under the leadership of Chinese and Tanzanian heads of state, the bilateral ties witnessed rapid growth, with increasing political mutual trust and robust practical cooperation across the board. We have firmly supported each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests and major concerns, and maintained close communication and coordination on international and regional affairs. China always views and develops relations with Tanzania from a strategic height and long-term perspective. We are ready to work with Tanzania to strengthen Belt and Road cooperation, implement the nine programs under FOCAC and achieve more new outcomes of the bilateral cooperation. 

   

   **赞比亚外长卡库博也是就任后首次访华。赞比亚是南部非洲第一个同中国建交的国家，两国传统友好。近年来，中赞各领域合作卓有成效，传统友谊持续加深。中方愿同赞方共同努力，进一步巩固政治互信，深化各领域务实合作，加强在国际和地区事务中的沟通和协调，造福两国和两国人民。**

   This will also be Foreign Minister of Zambia Stanley Kakubo’s first visit to China in his current capacity. Zambia is the first country in southern Africa to establish diplomatic relations with China. Our two countries enjoy traditional friendship. In recent years, bilateral cooperation in various sectors has made remarkable progress and the traditional friendship continues to deepen. China stands ready to work together with Zambia to further consolidate political mutual trust, deepen practical cooperation in various areas, strengthen communication and coordination in international and regional affairs, and deliver benefits to both countries and peoples. 

5. **彭博社记者：中国驻乌克兰大使范先荣会见利沃夫地区领导人时表示，我们看到乌克兰人民是多么团结，团结就是力量。他还表示，中国是乌克兰的朋友，尊重乌政体，愿助乌发展经济。外交部是否支持范大使所阐述的中方立场？**

   Bloomberg: China’s ambassador to Ukraine Fan Xianrong said while meeting regional leaders in Lviv that “we have seen how great the unity of the Ukrainian people is, and that means its strength”. He also said China was a friend to Ukraine and respected its state, and then it wanted to help Ukraine’s economy develop. Does the foreign ministry support the ambassador’s characterization of China’s position here? 

   **赵立坚：我们当然支持中国驻乌大使所作表态。中方支持一切有助于缓和乌克兰局势和政治解决的努力，反对一切不利于推动外交解决甚至使局势升级的行动。我们将继续为推动乌克兰局势缓和发挥建设性作用，并愿为克服人道主义危机作出自己的努力。**

   Zhao Lijian: We of course support our ambassador’s statement. China supports all efforts conducive to realizing deescalation and political settlement and opposes any act that is counterproductive to reaching diplomatic resolution or even leads to escalation. We will continue to play a constructive role in easing the situation in Ukraine and stand ready to contribute our efforts to overcoming the humanitarian crisis.

6. **美联社记者：美国司法部指控五人根据中国政府指令骚扰在美华裔异见人士。你对此有何评论？中国政府是否唆使这些人进行骚扰活动？对有关指控有何回应？**

   Associated Press: The US Justice Department has accused five men of harassing Chinese dissidents in the United States on behalf of the Chinese government. What can you tell us about this? Did the Chinese government do this? Did it instigate harassment? How does the Chinese government respond to this accusation?

   **赵立坚：我不了解你提到的具体情况。**

   Zhao Lijian: I am not aware of the specifics.

   

   **作为原则，我想强调的是，中方坚决反对美方借题发挥，毫无根据地诬蔑抹黑中方。中方一贯要求中国公民遵守所在国法律法规，从未也不会要求中国公民从事违反当地法律法规的活动。所谓的“跨国镇压计划”完全是无中生有。美方以此渲染“中国威胁”、抹黑中国形象的图谋不会得逞。**

   In principle, I want to emphasize that China firmly opposes the US’ unwarranted denigration and smearing against China by making excuses. China always asks Chinese citizens to abide by laws and regulations in host countries. We have never asked and will never ask Chinese citizens to do things in violation of local laws and regulations. The accusation of “transnational repression schemes” is totally made out of thin air. The US attempt to hype up “China threat” and tarnish China’s reputation is doomed to fail.

   

   **美方应该做的是，摒弃冷战思维和意识形态偏见，停止对中国的无端指责抹黑，多做促进中美关系的事。**

   The US side should abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological bias, stop groundless accusation and smearing against China, and do more to promote China-US relations.

7. **法新社记者：美国监管部门昨天吊销了太平洋网络的电信运营许可，称该公司为中国政府所有，这构成重大国家安全和执法风险。外交部对此有何评论？**

   AFP: US regulators yesterday revoked the telecommunications license of Pacific Networks, saying that the company’s ownership by the Chinese government raised “significant national security and law enforcement risks”. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on that?

   **赵立坚：我注意到有关报道。具体请你向中方主管部门询问。**

   Zhao Lijian: I noted relevant reports and would refer you to competent authorities of China for the specifics.

   

   **作为原则，我想强调的是，美方在没有列出具体违法事实的情况下，再次以“国家安全”为由撤销中国企业在美运营许可。这是赤裸裸地泛化国家安全概念，滥用国家力量对中国企业进行无理打压，是对国际经贸规则的严重破坏，损害的是包括美国用户在内的消费者的正当权益。中国政府支持相关企业依法维护自身利益，也将继续采取必要措施，坚决维护中国企业的正当权益。**

   In principle, I want to point out that the US, without providing any facts about offense, revoked the Chinese company’s license in the US with the excuse of “national security” again. This flagrant abuse of the national security concept and the use of state power to hobble Chinese companies gravely undermine international trade rules and hurt the legitimate rights and interests of consumers, including American users. The Chinese government supports relevant companies in defending their interests in accordance with law, and will continue to take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.

8. **彭博社记者：德国《图片报》称，最近俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫试图飞往北京，但飞机中途返航。请问中方是否曾邀请拉夫罗夫外长前往北京？该报道是否准确？**

   Bloomberg: The German newspaper Bild says that Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov tried to fly to Beijing recently, but his plane turned around halfway. Did China invite Lavrov to Beijing and is this report accurate? 

   **赵立坚：你最好去问问德国报纸，他们是从哪里得到的这个消息。**

   Zhao Lijian: You’d better ask the German newspaper where it got the information.

9. **路透社记者：位于海牙的国际法院作出一项有约束力的裁决，表示俄罗斯必须立即停止在乌克兰的军事行动。中国政府对此有何评论？**

   Reuters: The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague delivered a binding order saying the Russia must immediately suspend military operations in Ukraine. What’s the Chinese government’s comment? 

   **赵立坚：中方注意到国际法院基于《预防和惩治灭绝种族罪公约》发布的临时措施。法院法官独立履职，中方不作具体评论。事实上，除了俄罗斯和中国法官，另外4位法官也就裁决发表了声明或单独意见。有法官明确表示，支持法院发布临时措施是基于乌克兰当前局势和乌克兰人民遭遇，在法理上并不认同。**

   Zhao Lijian: China has noted the ICJ’s provisional measures based on the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. China will not comment on the specifics as the judges perform their duties independently. In fact, apart from Chinese and Russian judges, four judges have released their declaration or separate opinion on the Order. A judge noted explicitly that he was in favor of the Order indicating provisional measures due to the current situation in Ukraine and the suffering of the people, instead of the legality.

   

   **中方在乌克兰问题上的立场是一贯的。我们支持俄乌双方继续通过谈判协商妥善解决有关问题，支持国际社会为和平解决争端发挥积极作用。各方应避免增添复杂因素。**

   China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent. We support Russia and Ukraine in continuing to properly resolve the relevant issues through negotiation and consultation, and the international community in playing an active role in peacefully settling disputes. All parties should avoid making the issue more complicated.

10. **彭博社记者：英国军情六处前负责人称，只有习近平主席能够对普京总统施加影响停止乌克兰的战争。请问习近平主席是否与普京总统就乌克兰战争通过话？如果有的话，谈话内容是关于什么？**

    Bloomberg: The former head of Britain’s foreign intelligence service said that only Xi Jinping can influence Putin and stop the war in Ukraine. Has Xi been speaking to Putin about the war? What have those conversations been about if that happened? 

    **赵立坚：我注意到了有关表态。中方一直在劝和促谈，为和平解决乌克兰危机作出努力。习近平主席多次同相关国家领导人通电话，亲自做工作。中方会继续在乌克兰问题上发挥建设性作用。但解铃还须系铃人。我想强调的是，那些乌克兰危机的始作俑者们应该好好反思一下他们在乌克兰危机中扮演的角色，切实承担起应承担的责任，为缓和局势、解决问题拿出实际行动，而不是嫁祸于人。**

    Zhao Lijian: I noted the relevant remarks. China has been promoting dialogue for peace and making efforts for peacefully resolving the Ukraine crisis. Such efforts include the phone calls and personal efforts made by President Xi Jinping with leaders of relevant countries. China will continue to play a constructive role in the Ukraine issue. However, it takes the one who started the issue to resolve it. I want to stress that those who caused the Ukraine crisis should reflect on the roles they have played, earnestly shoulder their due responsibilities, take concrete actions to ease the situation and solve the problem, instead of shifting the blame onto others.

11. **路透社记者：你刚才提到，习近平主席多次同相关国家领导人通话。他最近与普京总统有过几次通话？请问他与乌克兰总统泽连斯基进行过几次通话？**

    Reuters: Just now you said that Chinese President Xi Jinping has had phone calls with his counterparts. How many times has Xi spoken to Vladimir Putin recently? How many times has he spoken to the President of Ukraine recently?

    **赵立坚：关于习近平主席通电话的相关消息，我们都及时发布了消息稿。**

    Zhao Lijian: We have released readouts on President Xi Jinping’s phone conversations with leaders in a timely manner. 

    

    **中方在乌克兰问题上将继续劝和促谈，发挥应有作用。我想强调的是，在和平与安全问题上，中国是纪录最好、信誉最好的大国。任何抹杀中方努力、歪曲中方意图的做法都是不负责任的。我们希望有关方面能够真正为推动乌克兰局势缓和做些实事，而不是动辄散布虚假信息、转嫁矛盾、挑动对抗、借机渔利。**

    China will continue to promote peace talks and play its due role in the Ukraine issue. I would like to emphasize that China is a major country with the most laudable record and credibility when it comes to peace and security. Any attempt to deny China’s efforts and distort China’s intention is irresponsible. We hope relevant sides can help to ease the situation in Ukraine in real earnest, rather than willfully spread disinformation to shift blames, instigate confrontation and reap profit from the situation. 

    

    **我也想问大家几个问题。美国曾五次推动北约东扩。美国声称推动北约东扩是为了维护和平，美国做到了吗？美国声称要防止欧洲发生战争，美国做到了吗？美国声称致力于危机的和平解决，除了提供军事援助、加大军事威慑外，美国做了哪些有利于和平的事呢？**

    I have a few question for you to ponder. The US claimed to defend peace by working on NATO’s five waves of eastward expansion. Is peace achieved? It said it was to prevent war in Europe. Is war averted? It advertised its commitment to a peaceful settlement of the crisis. But from providing military aid to beefing up military deterrence, did it do anything good for peace? 

    

    **中方始终按照事情本身的是非曲直决定自己的立场和政策。我们欢迎一切有利于乌克兰问题政治解决的外交努力，支持俄乌双方通过对话谈判寻求照顾双方合理关切、有利于欧洲长治久安的政治解决之道。我们将继续为寻求和平、实现和平发展发挥建设性作用。**

    China always independently decides its position and policies based on the merit of the matter itself. We welcome all diplomatic efforts conducive to the political settlement of the Ukraine issue, and support Russia and Ukraine in conducting dialogue and negotiation to seek a political settlement that accommodates both sides’ legitimate concerns and is good for lasting stability and security in Europe. China will continue to play a constructive role in seeking and achieving peace and development.

    

    **追问：最近没有发布习主席与泽连斯基总统通话的消息稿。这是否说明两人没怎么通话？**

    Follow-up: Since there hasn’t been so much information about calls between Xi and Zelenskyy lately, does that mean that Xi hasn’t spoken to Zelenskyy very much lately?

    

    **赵立坚：你说的没错。我希望你能更密切地关注外交部发布的消息。中乌外长通过电话，我们已发布了消息。但两国元首尚未进行过通话。**

    Zhao Lijian: You are right. I hope you can pay closer attention to the information released by our Foreign Ministry. The foreign ministers of China and Ukraine spoke on the phone. We have already released the information, but there was no phone conversation between the two heads of state.

    

    **追问：请问中方是否计划与泽连斯基总统通话？**

    Follow-up: Does China plan on speaking to President Zelenskyy?

    

    **赵立坚：目前我没有可以发布的消息。**

    Zhao Lijian: I have no information to offer at this point.

12. **路透社记者：中方签署了《联合国宪章》，其中第二条第三项原则是，“各会员国应以和平方法解决其国际争端，俾免危及国际和平、安全及正义”。第二条第四项原则是，“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立”。中方是否认为俄罗斯在乌克兰的行动遵守了以上原则？**

    Reuters: According to the UN Charter which China has signed up to, Article 2, Principle 3, “All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.” Article 2, Principle 4, “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Does China believe that Russia’s actions in Ukraine adhere to this?

    **赵立坚：你所说的问题我们在记者会已经多次作答。**

    Zhao Lijian: We have answered similar questions many times at this podium.

    

    **中方在乌克兰问题上的立场是光明磊落的，也是客观、公正和建设性的。我们的目的很明确，那就是推动尽快缓和局势，结束冲突。我们相信中方的立场会得到越来越多国家的理解和支持。中方的立场符合相关各方和世界各国的共同利益，也经得起历史检验。**

    China’s position on the Ukraine issue is aboveboard, objective, fair and constructive. Our aim is clear: to work for deescalation and end the conflict as soon as possible. We believe that China’s position will be understood and supported by more and more countries. China’s position conforms to the common interests of relevant parties and other countries in the world and can stand the test of history.

13. **路透社记者：美国国务卿布林肯表示，中国反复强调《联合国宪章》及关于国家主权的基本原则神圣不可侵犯，但至今还没有明确反对俄罗斯的侵略行为，言行完全相悖。中方对此有何评论？**

    Reuters: The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the fact that China hasn’t pronounced itself against Russia’s aggression is totally inconsistent with what China repeats over and over again about the sanctity of the UN Charter and basic principles in terms of the sovereignty of nations. What’s China’s comment?

    **赵立坚：我们注意到布林肯国务卿在作出这样表态时还妄称，中国站在历史错误的一边。美方有关言论是对中方的诬蔑抹黑，充分暴露了美方冷战思维和集团对抗思想。这类言论对解决问题毫无助益，中方坚决反对。**

    Zhao Lijian: We noted Secretary Blinken also claimed that “China is already on the wrong side of history” in his statement. Such smear against China fully exposes the US’ Cold War mentality featuring bloc confrontation. China is firmly opposed to such remarks that do no good to solving the problem.

    

    **在乌克兰问题上，中方始终本着客观公正态度，根据事情本身的是非曲直，独立自主作出判断。中方一贯主张尊重各国主权和领土完整，遵守联合国宪章宗旨和原则，重视各国安全关切，支持一切有利于和平解决危机的努力。作为负责任的大国，中国将继续为维护世界和平稳定发挥建设性作用。**

    On the Ukraine issue, China has been independently making its judgment based on the merits of the matter itself in an objective and just manner. The Chinese side always maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be observed. We attach importance to the security concerns of all countries and support all efforts that are conducive to peaceful resolution of the crisis. As a responsible major country, China will continue to play a constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability.

    

    **近来国际媒体多次提到，美国前驻苏联大使乔治·凯南在上世纪90年代就对政府提出忠告，指出北约针对俄罗斯的持续扩张将是美国政策中最致命的错误。还有很多国际著名国际问题专家也作出过这样的忠告。遗憾的是，美国政府对此置若罔闻，持续推进北约东扩，已经进行了五轮。美国政府关于北约东扩的决策，同今天的乌克兰危机有着直接联系。最近我看到一则报道，美国前国会众议员加巴德表示，只要美国保证不接纳乌克兰加入北约，就可以结束此次危机，阻止爆发战争，但美国政府不会这么做。**

    International media lately mentioned many times that George Kennan, former US ambassador to the Soviet Union, suggested to the US government in the 1990s that expanding NATO up to Russia’s borders would be the most fateful error of American policy. Many well-known experts on international relations across the world have also made such advice. Regrettably, the US government turned a deaf ear to this, and was bent on advancing NATO’s eastward expansion, for five times already. The US’ decision on NATO’s eastward expansion is directly linked to the Ukraine crisis now. I read a report the other day that Tulsi Gabbard, former member of the US House of Representatives, said the crisis could have been ended and the war easily avoided if the US had simply promised not to accept Ukraine’s becoming a member of NATO. But they chose not to do so. 

    

    

    **解决乌克兰危机的钥匙在美国和北约手中。我们希望美国和北约作为危机始作俑者好好反思一下他们在乌克兰危机中扮演的角色，切实承担起应尽责任，为缓和局势、解决问题拿出实际行动，早日结束乌克兰的冲突。我们也希望美国能够真正同世界上多数发展中国家一道，站在和平与正义的一边，推动乌克兰局势早日缓和。**

    The key to solving the Ukraine crisis is in the hands of the US and NATO. We hope the US and NATO, the culprits of the crisis, can reflect upon their roles in the Ukraine crisis. They should earnestly shoulder due responsibilities and take real actions to ease the situation, resolve the problem and end the conflict in Ukraine at an early date. We also hope that the US can truly work with most developing countries in the world to stand on the side of peace and justice and help to ease the Ukraine situation soon.

14. **路透社记者：几周前你同事说，俄罗斯国防部表示，俄方仅打击乌克兰军事目标。但有报道显示，在一些地区，平民成为攻击目标。比如，有报道称在基辅附近一座城市，排队买面包的平民被杀害。中国政府对于战争中平民成为袭击目标持何立场？**

    Reuters: A few weeks ago, your colleague noted that according to the Russian defense ministry, Russia was only targeting military targets in Ukraine. Reports have emerged that civilians have been targeted in a number of areas. For example, there were reports saying civilians waiting in line for bread were killed in a city close to Kiev. What’s the Chinese government’s position on civilians being targeted in this war?

    **赵立坚：我刚才回答问题时你没有听是吗？我刚才已就有关乌克兰平民的问题作出表态，不再赘述。**

    Zhao Lijian: You didn’t follow me when I was taking previous questions, did you? I just spoke at length about our statements on the Ukrainian civilians and I’m not going to repeat over and over.

15. **彭博社记者：追问一个昨天的问题。中国驻乌克兰大使表示，中国永远不会攻打乌克兰。这是否意味着中方不会向俄罗斯提供可用于攻打乌克兰的武器或其他援助？**

    Bloomberg: Can I just follow on what we asked earlier? China’s ambassador to Ukraine said that China would never attack Ukraine. Does that mean China will not supply Russia with weapons or other assistance that could be used to attack Ukraine?  

    **赵立坚：这是你自己的解释吧。中方已作出多次表态。你做这样的引申毫无道理。**

    Zhao Lijian: Is this your own interpretation? China has made statements on this on multiple occasions. Such association has no grounds whatsoever.

16. **会后有记者问及：据报道，16日，日本福岛县东北部海岸发生7.3级地震并引发海啸预警，迄已造成4人死亡，97人受伤。中方对此有何评论？是否有中国公民伤亡？**

    The following question was raised after the press conference. Q: According to reports, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted Japan’s northeast coast off the Fukushima prefecture on March 16, leaving four dead and 97 injured and triggering a tsunami advisory. What is China’s comment? Are there any Chinese casualties?

    **赵立坚：昨晚日本福岛县海域发生强震，我们对遇难者表示哀悼，向遇难者家属和伤者表示慰问。中国驻日本使馆和驻新潟总领馆、驻札幌总领馆已第一时间启动应急机制，紧急确认核实有关情况，截至目前没有收到中国公民伤亡报告。中国外交部和驻日使领馆将继续密切关注地震灾情和余震情况，及时向在日中国公民提供必要协助。**

    Zhao Lijian: A powerful earthquake struck waters near Japan’s Fukushima prefecture last night. We mourn for the victims, and express our condolences to the bereaved families and the wounded. The Chinese Embassy in Japan, the Consulate General in Niigata and the Consulate General in Sapporo immediately activated the emergency response mechanism and urgently checked the situation and verified relevant information. We have received no report of Chinese casualties so far. Our Foreign Ministry and the diplomatic missions in Japan will continue to closely follow the situation of the aftermath of the earthquake and the aftershocks, and will provide necessary assistance for Chinese citizens in Japan on a timely basis.

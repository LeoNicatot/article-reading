1. **总台央视记者：美国国务院发言人普莱斯称，美方对俄罗斯袭击乌克兰基础设施并造成平民伤亡表示关切。但中方一直未明确表明立场。发言人如何看待外界对中方的批评？**

   CCTV: US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said that the US is concerned about Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure which caused civilian casualties. However, China has yet to state its position explicitly. How does the foreign ministry view such criticism from other countries on China? 

   **赵立坚：人的生命是宝贵的。不管是什么情况造成的平民伤亡，总是令人痛心和惋惜的。中方一直呼吁尽力避免平民伤亡。大家都还记得，1999年3月，美国为首的北约在没有获得安理会授权的情况下，悍然对南联盟进行78天的持续轰炸。轰炸至少造成2500名无辜平民死亡，约一万人受伤，其中大部分是平民。过去20年来，美国在叙利亚、伊拉克、阿富汗、索马里等地发动了数万次空袭，无辜死亡的平民数量至少有2.2万，最高或达4.8万之多。美国在关心乌克兰人民的同时，是不是应该首先对上述这些军事行动中的平民伤亡也表示一下关切呢？**

   Zhao Lijian: Human lives are precious. Civilian casualties under all circumstances are **heart-rending** and lamentable. China has all along **called for** every effort to avoid civilian casualties. We still remember that in March 1999, the US-led NATO, without the Security Council’s **mandate**, **flagrantly** **unleashed** a **ruthless** bombing **campaign** against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for 78 days, killing at least 2,500 innocent civilians and injuring around 10,000 people, most of them civilians. Over the past two decades or so, the US conducted tens of thousands of **air strikes** in places like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. The number of innocent civilians killed can be anywhere between 22,000 and 48,000. When **professing** its concern for the welfare of the Ukrainian people, shouldn’t the US first express concern over the civilian casualties caused by all these military operations?

   **中方在乌克兰问题上一直秉持客观公正立场。冲突发生以来，中方一直以实际行动致力于劝和促谈。中方的公正立场和建设性努力有目共睹，得到了国际社会，特别是广大发展中国家的理解和支持。中方向乌克兰方面提供的，是食品、儿童奶粉、睡袋、棉被、防潮垫等急需的人道主义物资。而美方提供的却是致命性武器。3月16日，美方宣布向乌克兰提供额外8亿美元武器援助，本周美国对乌克兰武器援助的总额就达到10亿美元。我给大家念念也是美国国务院发言人普莱斯先生提到的清单。美方向乌方提供的最新武器装备包括800套防空系统，9000套便携式、高精度反装甲系统，7000件机枪、榴弹发射器等小型武器，以及2000万发炮弹和子弹。这还不是他的清单的全部。美方最新援助的武器是为乌克兰带去了稳定和安全吗？还是会给乌克兰造成更多的平民伤亡？对于乌克兰的平民来说，他们更需要的是食品和睡袋？还是机枪和炮弹？稍具理性和常识的人，对此都不难作出正确的判断。**

   China has all along held an objective and just position on the Ukraine issue. We have been taking concrete actions to promote talks for peace ever since the conflict broke out. Our just position and constructive efforts, witnessed by all, have received the understanding and support of the international community, especially the vast developing world. What China provides to Ukraine are much-needed humanitarian supplies such as food, baby **formula**, sleeping bags, quilts and damp-proof mats. In contrast, what the US provides to Ukraine are **lethal** weapons. On March 16, the US “announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total US security assistance committed to Ukraine to \$1 billion in just the past week”. Here I would like to share with you the list that Spokesperson Price mentioned. The new package includes, among others, 800 anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 portable, high-accuracy anti-armor systems, 7,000 small arms including machine guns and **grenade** launchers, and 20 million **rounds** of **ammunition**, **artillery**, and **mortar** rounds. The list goes on. Will the latest US assistance of weapons bring stability and security to Ukraine or cause more civilian casualties? Which do the civilians in Ukraine need more, food and sleeping bags or machine guns and mortar rounds? It won’t be difficult for anyone in his right mind with a **shred** of common sense to make the right call.

2. **新华社记者：据报道，美白宫发言人普萨基近日称，美方正在讨论如何支持乌克兰难民。中方对此有何评论？**

   Xinhua News Agency: It is reported that White House **Press Secretary** Jen Psaki said the other day that there are discussions in the US about ways to support Ukrainian refugees. Do you have any comment?

   > 1. Press Secretary原来是美国的白宫发言人的意思呀
   >
   > 话说新华社，央视记者最早提问以及根据他们提的问题，是不是有点像发了提问箱然后自问自答呀？不过确实，外媒不大可能问这些问题，但是我们又必须表明我们的态度

   **赵立坚：中方对乌克兰人道主义局势不断恶化深表担忧，对有关平民伤亡和难民人数增加的报道感到痛惜。当务之急是各方尽快停火止战，保持最大克制，保障平民安全和基本人道需求，防止发生更大规模的人道危机。中方高度重视乌克兰人道局势，提出了六点倡议主张。中国红十字会已经向乌克兰提供了三批人道援助物资。其中，第三批物资重点帮助乌克兰红十字会救助受冲突影响的流离失所的儿童。**

   Zhao Lijian: China **is gravely concerned over** the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine and is grieved for the increasing number of civilian casualties and refugees as reported by the media. The most urgent task is for all parties to cease fire and end the fighting as soon as possible, exercise maximum restraint, ensure the safety and basic humanitarian needs of civilians and prevent a more massive humanitarian crisis. China attaches great importance to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and has put forward a six-point initiative. The Red Cross Society of China has provided three **batches** of humanitarian supplies to Ukraine. The third batch is mainly supplies to help the Ukrainian Red Cross Society **deliver relief** to **displaced children** affected by the conflict. 

   > 1. batch：**N-COUNT**一批；一组；一群
   >
   > 2. relief：**N-UNCOUNT**救济;救援物资
   >
   >    注意，这里不是“宽慰，安心”的意思

   **我们欢迎各方提出的任何有助于缓解和解决乌克兰人道危机的倡议和举措。你刚才提到美方正在讨论如何支持乌克兰难民，我们希望美方能够尽快形成方案，将相关的讨论落实到行动中去。**

   We welcome all initiatives and measures proposed by all parties with an eye on alleviating and resolving the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. You just mentioned that there are discussions in the US about ways to support Ukrainian refugees. We hope the US can come up with a plan and take concrete actions to **follow through** on the discussions as soon as possible. 

   **乌克兰危机产生了数百万难民。美方早知如此，何必当初？美方应该深刻反思当前难民危机产生的根源到底是什么？美方在乌克兰危机中到底扮演了什么角色？美方应当承担哪些相应的责任和义务？如果不是北约连续五轮东扩导致地区安全严重失衡，乌克兰局势何以发展到今天的境地？当年不顾反对，执意作出北约东扩决定的国家，他们当年预想到如今难民的艰难处境了吗？大家说说，这些国家是不是最应该接收难民呢？暂且不谈美国发动阿富汗战争20年造成1100万难民家破人亡、流离失所。此次俄乌冲突已经有260多万难民涌入了欧洲国家。可以说，俄乌冲突真正受害方就是欧洲。而美方仍在隔岸观火，忽悠欧洲盟友。美国副总统近日到访波兰，被问及美国是否会接纳部分乌克兰难民时，我们听到的是她的哈哈的笑声，她并没有直接回应。世人看到的是，作为俄乌冲突的始作俑者和最大推手，美方至今在难民问题上仍只是惺惺作态。这颇具讽刺意味，这也很能说明问题。大家应该好好地想一想。**

   The Ukraine crisis has created millions of refugees. The US **should have done otherwise as it knows the consequences**. Some deep reflections have to be made. What is the root cause of the ongoing refugee crisis? What role did the US play in the Ukraine crisis? What are US’ due responsibilities and obligations? Could the situation evolve to where it is today had it not been for the seriously imbalanced regional security caused by NATO’s five rounds of eastward expansion? Did the countries that insisted on NATO’s eastward expansion despite opposition expect the suffering of refugees today? Don’t you think they are most supposed to accept the refugees? On top of the 11 million displaced refugees with their families torn apart due to the 20-year war waged by the US in Afghanistan, another 2.6 million refugees fleeing the Russia-Ukraine conflict have entered European countries, which are the real victims of the current situation, to be honest. However, the US is still looking on and fooling its European allies. During a recent visit to Poland, the US Vice President responded with a laugh rather than a direct answer to whether the US would accept Ukrainian refugees. What people across the globe are seeing is that as the one who initiated and **instigated** the conflict, the US is hypocritical on the issue of refugees. This is very ironic and **telling**. You should all think about this.

3. **法新社记者：关于今晚习近平主席与拜登总统的通话，美国国务卿布林肯表示，拜登总统会清楚表明，中方若采取行动支持俄罗斯侵略要承担责任。中国若决定协助俄罗斯，美国会让中方付出代价。你对此有何回应？习主席今晚会对拜登说些什么？中方对通话成果有何期待？**

   AFP: Ahead of tonight’s call between President Xi and President Biden, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Biden will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and added that the US will impose costs if China decides to assist Russia. What is the Chinese side’s response to this statement? What will Xi tell Biden on tonight’s call? What are China’s expectations for the outcome of this call?

   **赵立坚：关于你的第一个问题，在乌克兰问题上，中方始终本着客观公正态度，根据事情本身的是非曲直，独立自主地作出判断。中方一贯主张尊重各国主权和领土完整，遵守联合国宪章宗旨和原则，重视各国合理安全关切，支持一切有利于和平解决危机的努力，致力于劝和促谈，缓和人道主义局势。中方的立场光明磊落、公正客观、无可非议。事实上，这同世界上绝大多数国家的立场是一致的。**

   Zhao Lijian: Regarding your first question, on the Ukraine issue, China has always made its judgment independently and in an objective and just manner based on the merits of the matter itself. China has always stood for respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, attaching importance to the legitimate security concerns of all countries, supporting all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the crisis, and committing itself to promoting peace talks to ease the humanitarian situation. China’s position is aboveboard, just, objective and beyond reproach. In fact, our position is in line with that of the vast majority of countries in the world. 

   **美方一些人不断散布虚假信息，对中方抹黑施压，这种做法极其不负责任，对解决问题毫无助益。中方对此坚决反对，也绝不接受。美方应该做的是认真反思自己在乌克兰危机中扮演的角色和发挥的作用，切实承担应尽的责任，为缓和局势、解决问题拿出实际行动，而不是继续火上浇油，转嫁矛盾。**

   Some people on the US side keep spreading disinformation and smearing and pressuring China. Such practices are extremely irresponsible and do not help to solve the problem. China firmly opposes this and will never accept it. What the US should do is to seriously reflect on its role in the Ukraine crisis and the part it has played, effectively assume its due responsibilities, and take practical actions to ease the situation and solve the problem, instead of continuing to add fuel to the fire and shifting problems.

   **关于你提到的中美元首会晤的问题，中美两国元首通过各种形式保持着沟通。关于此次沟通，相信你已经看到了中方发布的消息。习近平主席将应约同美国总统拜登就中美关系和双方共同关心的问题交换意见。**

   Regarding your question on the talk between the Chinese and US leaders, the head of states are in communication in various forms. As for the upcoming one, I believe you have read China’s press release. Chinese President Xi Jinping will exchange views with US President Joe Biden upon invitation on China-US relations and issues of common concern. 

   **关于两国元首沟通的具体情况，建议你保持关注。我们会适时发布消息。**

   As for the specifics about this exchange, we suggest you follow the information to be released in due course.

4. **彭博社记者：关于习近平主席与拜登总统的通话，中方认为有没有可能中美领导人可以合力停止乌克兰的战争？**

   Bloomberg: Just on the Xi-Biden call, does China see the possibility for the leaders of the two countries to work together to end the war in Ukraine? 

   **赵立坚：我想两国元首通话的时候肯定会讨论他们关心的国际、地区问题，当然也包括乌克兰问题。两国元首会晤是双方就乌克兰问题交换意见的一次重要机会。让我们对这次沟通的成果拭目以待。**

   Zhao Lijian: I think the talk between the two heads of state will certainly cover international and regional issues of common concern including, of course, the Ukraine issue. The talk between the two heads of state is an important opportunity for the two sides to exchange views on the Ukraine issue. Let us wait and see the outcome of this exchange.

5. **法新社记者：美国总统拜登断言俄罗斯军队在乌克兰故意袭击平民犯下战争罪。美国国务卿布林肯昨天重申了这一观点。你刚才提到中方了解乌克兰遭到破坏和平民伤亡的情况。请问中方对于这些伤亡是由俄军造成的这一点是否感到关切？如果可能的话，能否避免探讨在过去的冲突中美国行动可能造成的平民伤亡？**

   AFP: The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken yesterday repeated President Biden’s assertion that Russian forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine by deliberately targeting civilians. You just spoke about China’s awareness of the scale of damage and civilian casualties in Ukraine. But I’d like to ask whether China has any concerns at all that these civilian casualties have been caused by Russian forces? If it’s possible, could we avoid talking about previous US actions that may have caused civilian casualties in previous conflicts?

   **赵立坚：关于平民的事，我这些天已经答过很多次了。中方当然对平民的伤亡表示惋惜。**

   Zhao Lijian: I have answered many questions about civilians in recent days. Of course China is saddened by civilian casualties. 

   **我不知道你一直纠缠这个问题是什么意思。我也想在这里借你的问题反问你一句。你是法新社的记者，作为一个欧洲主要的媒体、主要的通讯社，我想你们作为记者，也应该反思反思。美国作为乌克兰危机的始作俑者，为什么美国人一直在对中国进行污蔑抹黑，而不是去反思一下美北约一味东扩造成的欧洲安全困境？为什么美方没有倾听包括基辛格在内的那些专家关于“乌克兰不应成为东西方对抗前哨”的呼吁？为什么美国不去反省自身在乌克兰煽风点火后旋即隔岸观火的虚伪行径？你们欧洲人没想一想吗？美国人有本事搞北约东扩，为什么他们不派兵去支持乌克兰人民呢？你们没有忘记吧？美国是第一批从乌克兰撤出平民和使领馆人员的。你们想没想过美国不会为乌克兰死一个士兵呢？作为一个欧洲的媒体，你们有没有反思，为什么欧洲会沦为战场？会沦为大国博弈的竞技场？为什么乌克兰会沦为大国博弈的棋子和牺牲品呢？作为欧洲主要通讯社的记者，你们是不是也应该去问一下美方？**

   There is no point in badgering us on this question. I also have a question for you. As a journalist working with AFP, a mainstream media and news agency in Europe, you need to think about the following questions. As the culprit of the Ukraine crisis, why does the US keep smearing China instead of reflecting on the security predicament in Europe caused by the eastward expansion of US-led NATO? Why doesn’t the US listen to the observation by Dr. Kissinger and other experts that Ukraine must not be either side’s outpost against the other? Why doesn’t the US reflect on its hypocritical move of watching the fire from across the river after fanning the flames? I am not sure if it occurred to the Europeans that the US was fully capable of pushing for NATO’s eastward expansion but sent no troops to support the Ukrainian people. Did you forget that the US was among the first to evacuate civilians and diplomatic personnel from Ukraine? Have you ever imagined that the US would never send a single soldier to fight and die for Ukraine? You are associated with a media outlet from Europe. Did you ever think about why has Europe become a battlefield and a wrestling ground of major-country rivalry? Why has Ukraine become a pawn to be sacrificed in major-country rivalry? Maybe our friends from major European media outlets should also raise these questions to the US. 

   **美方最不应该做的，就是向中国这样一个非当事方大泼脏水。美国这种卑劣行径恰恰暴露了美方做贼心虚的心理、祸水东引的祸心和他们借乌克兰危机渔利的真实意图。**

   The last thing the US should do is to sling mud at China which is not a party directly concerned. The despicable move of the US only serves to reveal its guilty conscience and true intention to shift the blame and profit from the Ukraine crisis.

6. **路透社记者：知情消息人士向路透社透露，中国航母山东舰周五穿越敏感的台湾海峡，一艘美国驱逐舰尾随。此次穿越就在中美元首通话数小时前，这是巧合吗？**

   Reuters: China sailed its aircraft carrier, the Shandong, through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday shadowed by a US destroyer, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. This took place just hours before the Chinese and US presidents were due to talk. Was the timing of this a coincidence?

   **赵立坚：你说的这个事情跟外交部没有关系吧？你自己也说了这是一个coincidence。**

   Zhao Lijian: This doesn’t fall within the purview of the foreign ministry, does it? You yourself wondered if it is a coincidence.

   **我不知道你所说的有关山东舰航母的具体情况。但是我觉得山东舰航母有例行的训练安排。我们不应该把这个事情跟中美元首的沟通联系在一起。我觉得你可能是太敏感了吧。敏感的是你，恐怕不是台湾海峡。**

   I’m not aware of the specific situation about the Shandong aircraft carrier you just mentioned. But I’m sure the aircraft carrier has routine training arrangement. One shouldn’t link this with the communication between the Chinese and US heads of state. I think you may be too sensitive. Perhaps what is sensitive is you, not the Taiwan Strait.

7. **法新社记者：鉴于中国与朝鲜边境附近出现新冠肺炎疫情，中方对朝鲜官方表示国内无病例是否感到满意？中方是否请朝方遵循清零策略以保护中国居民？两国是否在考虑进一步加强边境管控？**

   AFP: Given the COVID-19 outbreaks near China’s border with North Korea, is China satisfied that there are no COVID cases in that country as its authorities claim? Has China asked North Korea to follow a zero-COVID strategy to protect communities in China? And are the two sides considering any further tightening of border controls?

   **赵立坚：由于疫情的影响，中国和朝鲜之间的正常人文交流和贸易受到了一些影响。我想随着疫情过去，这些问题都会得到逐步地解决。关于朝鲜疫情的形势我不掌握有关情况，你可以向有关方面去询问。**

   Zhao Lijian: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, normal people-to-people exchange and trade between China and the DPRK have been affected to some extent. I think the problems will be solved gradually when the epidemic ends. I don’t have any information about the COVID-19 situation in the DPRK, and I would like to refer you to the competent authorities.

8. **路透社记者：刚才法新社的记者问到了平民伤亡的问题，我无意询问你的观点，只想确认一下，据中国政府了解，那些中方感到痛惜的平民伤亡，大部分是由俄军造成的还是由乌军造成的？**

   Reuters: Just now my **colleague** over there from AFP asked questions about civilian casualties. So I’m not looking to ask for your opinion, but I just wondered as far as the Chinese government is aware, most of the civilian casualties that China has just said it is grieved about, were they caused by the Russian military or the Ukraine military? 

   > colleague这里应当理解成“同行”而不是“同事”

   **赵立坚：这个恐怕你得去问俄方吧？你得去问乌方吧？中国是当事方吗？你问我，我可以明确地告诉你，中方的立场是十分清楚的。你没必要再无理纠缠这样的问题。**

   Zhao Lijian: You may have to ask Russia or Ukraine this question. Is China a party directly related to the situation? I can tell you that China’s position is very clear. It makes no sense to pursue an answer to a question like this.

   > 赵立坚的回答风格果然和其他发言人不一样，像是个唱黑脸的角色

9. **彭博社记者：请问习近平主席是否计划与乌克兰总统泽连斯基通话？**

   Bloomberg: Can we just ask, does Xi Jinping have any plans to speak with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine? 

   **赵立坚：我昨天已经回答了这个问题。**

   Zhao Lijian: I answered this question yesterday.

10. **路透社记者：追问一下彭博社刚才的问题，我们注意到，泽连斯基总统已对多国政客发表演讲，最近一次是在德国议会。我知道两会已经结束，不知道中方是否也计划邀请他作类似的演讲？**

    Reuters: Following on my colleague from Bloomberg there. We’ve observed that President Zelenskyy has spoken to politicians in various countries, most recently the German parliament. I know the Two Sessions have finished now, but I wondered if China **planned on** inviting Zelenskyy to speak to them in a similar way? 

    **赵立坚：我不知道有这样的安排。**

    Zhao Lijian: I’m not **aware** of such arrangement.

    > 1. aware：**ADJ-GRADED**知道的；明白的

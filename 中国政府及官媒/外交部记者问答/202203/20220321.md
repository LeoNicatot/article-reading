1. **总台央视记者：日前，王毅国务委员兼外长在安徽屯溪同赞比亚、阿尔及利亚以及坦桑尼亚三国外长举行会谈。你能否进一步介绍有关情况？**

   CCTV: State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi just held talks with the foreign ministers of Zambia, Algeria and Tanzania in Tunxi, Anhui Province. Could you share more details with us?

   **汪文斌：3月19至20日，王毅国务委员兼外长在安徽屯溪同到访的赞比亚外长卡库博、阿尔及利亚外长拉马拉分别举行会谈，并同对华进行视频访问的坦桑尼亚外长穆拉穆拉举行视频会谈。**

   Wang Wenbin: From March 19 to 20, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks in Tunxi, Anhui Province with visiting Zambian Foreign Minister Stanley Kakubo and Algerian Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra respectively and held talks via video link with Tanzanian Foreign Minister Liberata Mulamula, who is paying a virtual visit to China. 

   **中方同三国就深化抗疫和医疗卫生合作、共建“一带一路”、助力非洲发展振兴、促进国际关系民主化进程、加强国际多边事务协调配合等达成多项共识，加深了彼此传统友谊，深化了双方务实合作。**

   China and the three countries reached consensus on deepening anti-epidemic, medical and health cooperation, jointly building the Belt and Road, boosting Africa’s development and revitalization, promoting democracy in international relations and strengthening coordination and cooperation in multilateral affairs. Traditional friendship has been deepened and practical cooperation enhanced.

   **中国和三国外长都认为，当前乌克兰危机对欧洲局势产生巨大冲击并正在向全球外溢，但这个世界大得很，问题也多得很，非洲这片大陆尤其不应被忘却，不应再被边缘化，更不应成为受害者。越是国际局势动荡的时刻，越要重视非洲国家的呼声，越要加大对非洲的支持和帮助。作为非洲国家的好兄弟，中国将继续同非洲站在一起，坚定支持非洲维护和平安全，坚定支持非洲实现经济复苏，坚定支持非洲捍卫正当权益，为非洲的独立自主和可持续发展作出应有贡献。**

   The four foreign ministers agreed that the current Ukraine crisis has had a huge impact on the situation in Europe and is spilling over to the world. But we live in a big world with many problems. The African Continent in particular should not be forgotten and should no longer be marginalized, still less should it become a victim. The more **turbulent** the international situation is, the more we must pay attention to the voices of African countries and increase our support for and assistance to Africa. As a good brother of African countries, China will continue to stand with Africa, firmly support Africa in maintaining peace and security, achieving economic recovery, and defending its legitimate rights and interests, and make due contributions to Africa’s independence and sustainable development.

   **王毅国务委员兼外长在同阿尔及利亚外长共见记者时表示，近段时间同很多亚洲、非洲国家外长交换意见，感到世界上很多国家都与中国一样，高度关注乌克兰危机发展，也有很多共同语言。首先大家都认为，联合国宪章的宗旨和原则应当得到遵循，国际争端应当通过和平手段得到解决，当事方应当尽快停火止战。同时，大家都认为，乌克兰问题走到今天是各种因素综合作用的结果，也是多年积累矛盾的爆发，根子在于欧洲的安全问题，北约无限制东扩的做法值得反思。从长远计，欧洲各方还是应当本着安全不可分割原则，在尊重彼此合理关切基础上，通过对话谈判，构建起平衡、有效、可持续的地区安全架构。**

   When jointly meeting the press with the Algerian foreign minister, State Councilor Wang said that after exchanging views with many foreign ministers of Asian and African countries recently, he felt that many countries, like China, are closely following the development of the Ukraine crisis and have much in common. To start with, all believe that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be **observed**, that international disputes should be resolved peacefully, and the parties concerned should cease hostilities as soon as possible. At the same time, all believe that the situation in Ukraine has come to where it is today as a result of the interplay of various factors and the outbreak of problems and tensions built up over the past years. At the root is the security issue in Europe. The unchecked eastward expansion of NATO is worth reflection. In the long run, parties in Europe should follow **the principle of indivisible security** and build a balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture through dialogue and negotiation on the basis of respecting each other’s legitimate concerns.

   > 1. observe
   > 2. the principle of indivisible security

   **乌克兰危机的演变正在超越自身，溢出效应波及全球。在这一问题上，包括中国和发展中国家在内的大多数国家既有合理的关切，也有相似的立场。大家都普遍认为：一是处理国际地区热点问题，并不是只有战争和制裁两种选择，对话谈判才是根本解决之道，当前形势下更应当坚持这一方向。二是世界经济复苏势头不应受到破坏。不断升级的单边制裁，将造成全球产业链供应链断裂，导致各国民众生活受到冲击。各国人民并没有责任为地缘冲突和大国博弈埋单。三是各国都有权独立自主地决定自身对外政策，不应被强迫选边站队。处理复杂问题，对待不同意见，不应采取非敌即友、非黑即白的简单化做法，尤其要抵制冷战思维，反对阵营对抗。四是各国的主权独立和领土完整任何时候都应当得到尊重。这一原则对所有国家和地区都应适用，不应当有例外，更不能搞双重标准。**

   The Ukraine crisis is developing in a way that goes beyond itself, with **spillovers** affecting the whole world. In this regard, the majority of countries in the world, including China and other developing countries, share reasonable concerns and hold similar positions. It is a widely shared view that: First, when addressing regional and international hotspot issues, war and sanctions are not the only options, and dialogue and negotiation is the fundamental **way out**. Under the current circumstances, it is more important to stick to this direction. Second, the momentum of world economic recovery should not be disrupted. Escalating unilateral sanctions will **fracture** the global industrial and supply chains and hurt the livelihood of people of all countries, who should by no means be made to bear the **brunt** of geopolitical conflicts and major-country rivalry. Third, all countries have the right to independently decide their foreign policies, and should not be forced to choose sides. When dealing with complex issues and divergent views, one should not opt for the simplistic approach of “friend or **foe**” and “black or white”. It is particularly important to reject Cold War mentality and **bloc** confrontation. Fourth, the sovereign independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected at all times. This principle applies to all countries and regions. There should be no exception, still less double standards.

2. **新华社记者：我们注意到，中国红十字会此前宣布向乌克兰提供价值500万元人民币的人道主义物资援助。中方是否计划提供更多援助？**

   Xinhua News Agency: We have noticed that the Red Cross Society of China announced earlier that China would provide Ukraine with humanitarian assistance worth 5 million yuan. Does China plan to provide more assistance?

   **汪文斌：中方对在乌俄冲突中平民受到伤害极为关注。应对可能出现的大规模人道危机，是目前国际社会的当务之急。中方已就缓解乌克兰人道主义局势提出六点倡议，并采取实际行动，向乌方提供了一批紧急人道援助。**

   Wang Wenbin: China is paying close attention to the suffering of civilians in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The most pressing task for the international community at present is to avert a potential large-scale humanitarian crisis. China has put forth a six-point initiative on easing the humanitarian situation and has taken concrete actions, including providing a batch of emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.

   **中国政府决定，再向乌克兰提供一批价值1000万元人民币的人道主义物资援助。这是中方根据形势发展和实际需要新增的对乌人道主义援助。中方将继续为推动乌克兰局势缓和发挥建设性作用，并愿为克服人道主义危机作出自己的努力。**

   The Chinese government has decided to provide an additional batch of humanitarian assistance of 10 million yuan’s worth of supplies to Ukraine in light of the evolving situation and actual needs on the ground. China will continue to play a constructive role in helping deescalate the situation in Ukraine and stands ready to contribute to overcoming the humanitarian crisis.

3. **《中国日报》记者：据报道，习近平主席在同南非总统拉马福萨通电话时积极评价双方签署《中南合作战略规划（2020-2029）》。你能否介绍一下这份文件的主要内容和意义？**

   China Daily: It is reported that President Xi Jinping spoke highly of the signing of the 10-year strategic programme on cooperation between China and South Africa in his phone conversation with President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa. Could you tell us more about this document’s content and significance?

   **汪文斌：《中华人民共和国和南非共和国十年合作战略规划2020-2029》是中南双方共同致力于打造着眼未来、面向世界的全面战略伙伴关系的重要政策文件，提出了双方在政治、经贸、人文等多领域开展合作的指导原则、具体规划和政策措施，阐述了双方在重大国际、地区问题及重要国际合作机制上的合作共识，由王毅国务委员兼外长和南非国际关系与合作部部长潘多尔于近期共同签署。**

   Wang Wenbin: The 10 Years Strategic Programme on Cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa (2020-2029) is an important policy document for the two countries to develop a future-oriented comprehensive strategic partnership with a global vision. It puts forward the guiding principles, specific plans and policy measures for bilateral cooperation in the political, economic, trade, cultural and other fields. It expounds on the two sides’ consensus on major international and regional issues as well as important international cooperation mechanisms. The document was recently signed by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Minister Naledi Pandor of South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation.

   **近年来，中南全面战略伙伴关系保持强劲发展势头。疫情发生以来，两国元首通过电话和信函保持密切沟通，为中南关系发展提供了战略引领。《规划》的签署将全面指导新形势下中南关系发展，为双方各领域合作增添新的动力。**

   In recent years, China-South Africa comprehensive strategic partnership has maintained a strong momentum of growth. Since the start of COVID-19, the heads of state of the two countries have maintained close communication through phone calls and letters, providing strategic guidance for the development of bilateral relations. The signing of the Plan will serve as a comprehensive guideline to the development of China-South Africa relations under the new circumstances and add new impetus to bilateral cooperation across the board.

   **中方愿同南非密切协调配合，加快落实《规划》各项内容，将规划举措转化成惠及两国人民的合作成果，推动中南全面战略伙伴关系再上新台阶。**

   China is ready to work closely with South Africa to speed up the implementation of the Plan, translate the measures into cooperation outcomes to the benefit of the two peoples, and take the China-South Africa comprehensive strategic partnership to a new level.

4. **日本共同社记者：现在俄罗斯的国内经济和外贸都面临着很大的困难。中国作为俄罗斯的重要合作伙伴，在经济方面能提供什么样支持或援助？**

   Kyodo News: Russia now faces great difficulties in its domestic economy as well as foreign trade. As Russia’s important cooperation partner, what kind of support or assistance can China provide economically? 

   **汪文斌：中俄双方一直在平等互利、相互尊重的基础上开展正常的经贸合作。**

   Wang Wenbin: China and Russia conduct normal economic and trade cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect.

5. **彭博社记者：俄罗斯国防部发布消息称，俄国防部副部长亚历山大·福明上周五会见了中国驻俄大使，你能否证实？如果报道属实，会见的目的是什么？取得了哪些主要成果？**

   Bloomberg: According to a Russian Ministry of Defense press release, we’re hearing that the Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin and the Chinese ambassador to Moscow held talks on Friday. I wonder if you could confirm these reports. If accurate, what was the purpose of such talks? What was the main outcome?

   **汪文斌：上周五，中国驻俄罗斯大使张汉晖会见了俄罗斯国防部副部长福明，双方就中俄双边关系等交换了意见。同驻在国政府部门负责人开展正常交往是驻外使节的工作，没有必要过度解读。**

   Wang Wenbin: Chinese Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui met with Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin last Friday to exchange views on bilateral relations and other issues. It is the job of diplomats to conduct normal exchange with officials of the countries they are posted in. There is no need to read too much into this.

6. **澎湃新闻记者：近日，在塞尔维亚首都贝尔格莱德举行的欧罗巴联赛16强比赛中，现场观众拉起多条横幅，历数美国、北约过去数十年中发动战争波及的国家及地区，并高唱反战歌曲。发言人对此有何评论？**

   The Paper: Recently, spectators at a Europa League last-16 match in Belgrade, capital of Serbia, unfurled banners with the names of countries and regions that suffered from wars launched by the US and NATO over the last few decades and chanted an anti-war song. Do you have any comment?

   **汪文斌：我也注意到有关报道。现场球迷用整整5条巨型横幅列举了过去几十年遭受美国、北约战火侵袭的国家和地区，从危地马拉、古巴、越南、刚果，到尼加拉瓜、伊拉克、南联盟，再到阿富汗、利比亚、叙利亚等，让全世界的人们再次重温了美国和北约过去几十年来的战争史，也促使人们深入思考：**

   Wang Wenbin: I also took note of the relevant report. Football fans at the match unveiled five huge banners to list countries and regions that suffered from the scourge of war waged by the US and NATO over the last few decades. Guatemala, Cuba, Vietnam, the Congo, Nicaragua, Iraq, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria. The list goes on. People all over the world who see these banners revisit the wars launched by the US and NATO in the past few decades. The locations set us thinking.

   **国际上那些声称“反对战争”的国家，自己是不是不应当去发动战争呢？那些声称“维护和平”的国家，自己是不是不应当破坏和平呢？那些声称要维护自身安全的国家，是不是也应当尊重别国的安全呢？**

   Shouldn’t the countries who claim to oppose war avoid starting wars in the first place? Shouldn’t the countries who claim to advocate peace refrain from undermining peace? Shouldn’t the countries who want to uphold their own security respect the security of other countries too?

7. **彭博社记者：据报道，中国驻斯里兰卡大使在科伦坡对记者表示，中方正考虑向斯里兰卡提供新的援助，你可否证实并介绍更多细节？**

   Bloomberg: There are reports that China’s ambassador to Sri Lanka told reporters in Colombo that China is considering fresh assistance to Sri Lanka. Can you confirm this and can you offer any more details about this arrangement?

   **汪文斌：你提到的情况我不了解。中斯建交以来，两国始终相互理解、相互支持。中方一直在力所能及范围内为斯方经济社会发展提供帮助，未来我们还将继续这么做。相信在斯里兰卡政府和人民的团结努力下，斯方一定能尽快克服暂时的困难，迎来新的更大发展。**

   Wang Wenbin: I am not aware of the situation you mentioned. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Sri Lanka, our two countries have always rendered each other mutual understanding and mutual support. China has been providing help to Sri Lanka’s economic and social development to the best of its capability and will continue to do so in the future. It is believed that with the concerted efforts of the Sri Lankan government and people, the country will overcome temporary difficulties at an early date and embrace greater development.

8. **湖北广播电视台记者：中国—中东欧国家合作的旗舰项目——匈塞铁路塞尔维亚贝诺段通车仪式隆重举行。塞尔维亚总统武契奇、匈牙利总理欧尔班等多名政要出席仪式，表示这条铁路将匈塞两国人民更加紧密地联系在一起，希望早日实现全线通车。中方能否介绍有关情况？**

   Hubei Media Group: The commission ceremony of a stretch of railway connecting Belgrade and Novi Sad was held. It is part of the Belgrade-Budapest railway, a flagship project of China-CEEC cooperation. Serbia’s President Vučić, Hungary’s Prime Minister Orban and other dignitaries attended the ceremony and said the railway will bring the people of Serbia and Hungary closer to each other and expressed the hope that the railway will begin full operation at an early date. Can you tell us more about it?

   **汪文斌：我们对匈塞铁路塞尔维亚贝诺段顺利通车表示祝贺。匈塞铁路项目是“一带一路”的重点项目，也是中国—中东欧国家合作的旗舰项目，是中欧加强互联互通合作的有益尝试。匈塞铁路项目不断取得新进展，有利于提升地区铁路通道客货运输能力，便利沿线民众出行，促进沿线旅游资源开发和城市化建设，助力中欧共建“一带一路”高质量发展。事实证明，匈塞铁路是一个互利合作、开放共赢的合作项目，各项工作依照欧盟法律法规推进。中方欢迎各方以多种方式参与项目合作，共同为提高中东欧国家间互联互通水平作出贡献。**

   Wang Wenbin: We extend congratulations on the commission of a stretch of the Belgrade-Budapest railway that connects Belgrade and Novi Sad in Serbia. The railway is a key project of the Belt and Road Initiative and a flagship project of China-CEEC cooperation. It is also a meaningful effort for China and Europe to enhance connectivity. The new progress in this project helps to improve the passenger and freight transport capacity of regional railway, makes it more convenient for people along the railway to travel, promotes the development of tourism and urbanization and contributes to high-quality Belt and Road cooperation between China and Europe. Facts show that the Belgrade-Budapest railway is a mutually beneficial, open and win-win cooperation project. All relevant work of the railway is conducted in accordance with EU laws and regulations. China welcomes the participation of all sides in various ways to jointly contribute to improving connectivity among Central and Eastern European Countries.

9. **《环球时报》记者：今天是消除种族歧视国际日，我们注意到中国常驻联合国副代表在第76届联大消除种族歧视国际日纪念会议上严辞驳斥美方就涉疆问题对中方的攻击抹黑。你能否进一步介绍有关情况？**

   Global Times: Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. We have noted that at the commemorative meeting for the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly, China’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN refuted sternly US’ attacks and defamation against China on issues relating to Xinjiang. Could you offer some further information?

   **汪文斌：种族歧视严重侵犯人权。联合国历来关注种族问题，于1965年通过了《消除一切形式种族歧视公约》，要求各国采取一切必要措施消除一切种族歧视。作为公约缔约国，美国一直纵容种族歧视，未能采取有效措施改变系统性的种族歧视，严重违反公约义务。例如，疫情期间，美国政府高层公然针对亚裔群体搞污名化和种族歧视。美国内针对亚裔群体的暴力行为层出不穷，最新民调显示，美国洛杉矶县三分之二的亚裔居民担心成为种族歧视下的受害者。私营监狱对有色人种和移民群体严重不公平对待，因为种族歧视导致的杀害非裔美国人和其他少数族裔的事件时有发生。美国的种种人权劣迹，已遭到多位联合国人权特别机制报告员点名批评。**

   Wang Wenbin: Racial discrimination severely violates human rights. The UN has a long-standing tradition of focusing on racial issues. In 1965, it adopted the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, urging all countries to adopt all necessary measures for eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations. The US, as a State Party to the Convention, has connived at racial discrimination and failed to take effective measures to address systemic racial discrimination, which constitutes grave violation of its obligations under the Convention. For example, after COVID-19 broke out, senior officials of the US administration openly engaged in stigmatization and racial discrimination against the Asian community. There are frequent violent acts targeting the Asian community in the US. A latest survey reveals that two-thirds of the Asian American residents in Los Angeles County said they are worried about being a victim of racial discrimination. In private prisons, people of color and migrants suffer from gravely unfair treatment. Killings of African Americans and other ethnic minorities driven by racial discrimination occur every now and then. The US’ human rights violations have been called out by several rapporteurs of the UN human rights special procedures. 

   **面对如此糟糕的人权记录，美国不仅不反躬自省，反而以人权“教师爷”自居，把人权政治化、武器化，作为对别国干涉施压的工具，动辄对其他国家人权指手画脚。这是对国际法和国际关系基本准则的公然破坏，更与国际社会消除种族歧视、尊重和保障人权的努力背道而驰。**

   In the face of such a deplorable human rights record, the US, instead of reflecting upon itself, styles itself as a human rights lecturer and chooses to politicize and weaponize human rights and use it as a tool to interfere in other countries’ affairs, pressure them and wantonly criticize their human rights conditions. This is flagrantly undermining international law and basic norms governing international relations. It also runs counter to the international community’s efforts to eliminate racial discrimination and respect and protect human rights. 

   **我们奉劝美方放下傲慢和偏见，对着“人权”的镜子照照自己，正视自身问题，切实遵守《消除一切形式种族歧视公约》等国际人权公约，知错认错，知错改错。让少数群体真正感受到公平正义，给正在遭受仇恨和暴力的亚裔人群真正的安全和保护，真正为改善本国人权做一些实实在在的事情。**

   We urge the US to let go of its arrogance and bias and take a hard look at its problems in the mirror of human rights and earnestly abide by international human rights conventions including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It should admit to and rectify its mistakes, truly deliver equity and justice to ethnic minorities, offer real protection for the safety of people of Asian descent suffering from hate crimes and violence, and take concrete measures to improve its human rights situation.

   **我还想强调的是，西方一些媒体在近期的报道中突出“白人”的身份认同，以自我设定的标准将不同种族分出“文明等级”，有选择地展现所谓同情，发表诸如“这些不是来自叙利亚的难民，他们是基督徒，他们是白人，他们与我们很相似”等种族歧视言论，这严重背离人道主义初心和人权保护原则。针对西方媒体的种族主义言论，联合国难民署发言人近日强调，无论流离失所者来自乌克兰，抑或阿富汗、叙利亚，“我们必须记住，他们都是人”。我们希望西方一些媒体，早日抛弃双重标准，多做有利于文明交流的事情，真正为和平服务，不要沦为渲染种族主义的平台。**

   I would also like to stress that recently in some western media reports, there is an emphasis on the “white people” identity and a race-based “civilization hierarchy” by their own standards. They display their so-called sympathy selectively and make such comments as “these are not refugees from Syria. These are Christians, they’re white, they’re very similar people”. These racist remarks deviate severely from the original mission of humanitarianism and the principle of protecting human rights. Responding to such remarks in western media, a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency recently stressed that no matter where the displaced persons come from, Ukraine, Afghanistan or Syria, we must remember that they are all human beings. We hope some western media will discard double standards as soon as possible, do more things conducive to promoting exchange between civilizations and serve peace in real earnest instead of being reduced to a platform for racism.

10. **法新社记者：英国首相约翰逊周日呼吁中国同其他国家一道谴责俄罗斯入侵乌克兰。外交部对此有何回应？**

    AFP: The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday urged China to join other nations in condemning the Russian invasion in Ukraine. What is the foreign ministry’s response to the request?

    **汪文斌：中方在乌克兰问题上一直秉持客观公正的立场。日前，习近平主席应约同美国总统拜登视频通话时指出，乌克兰局势发展到这个地步，是中方不愿看到的。中方历来主张和平，反对战争。我们向来从事情本身的是非曲直出发，独立自主作出判断，倡导维护国际法和公认的国际关系基本准则，坚持按照联合国宪章办事，主张共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观。这些大的原则是中方处理乌克兰危机的立足点。中方已经提出了关于乌克兰人道主义局势的六点倡议，愿向乌克兰和受影响的其他国家进一步提供人道主义援助。各方应该共同支持俄乌对话谈判，谈出结果、谈出和平。美国和北约也应该同俄罗斯开展对话，解开乌克兰危机的背后症结，化解俄乌双方的安全忧虑。**

    Wang Wenbin: China always takes an objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue. During a video call with US President Joe Biden at his request lately, President Xi Jinping pointed out that China does not want to see the situation in Ukraine to come to this. China stands for peace and opposes war. China makes a conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter. China advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations. China adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. These are the major principles that underpin China’s approach to the Ukraine crisis. China has put forward a six-point initiative on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and stands ready to provide further humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other affected countries. All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace. The US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.

    **习近平主席强调，形势越是复杂，越需要保持冷静和理性。任何情况下都要拿出政治勇气，为和平创造空间，为政治解决留有余地。关键是当事方要展现政治意愿，着眼当下，面向未来，找到妥善解决办法，其他方面可以也应当为此创造条件。当务之急是继续对话谈判，避免平民伤亡，防止出现人道主义危机，早日停火止战。长久之道在于大国相互尊重、摒弃冷战思维、不搞阵营对抗，逐步构建均衡、有效、可持续的全球和地区安全架构。中国一直在为和平尽力，将继续发挥建设性的作用。**

    President Xi stressed that the more complex the situation, the greater the need to remain cool-headed and rational. Whatever the circumstances, there is always a need for political courage to create space for peace and leave room for political settlement. It is imperative that the parties involved demonstrate political will and find a proper settlement in view of both immediate and long-term needs. Other parties can and should create conditions to that end. The pressing priority is to keep the dialogue and negotiation going, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, and cease hostilities as soon as possible. An enduring solution would be for major countries to respect each other, reject the Cold War mentality, refrain from bloc confrontation, and build step by step a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for the region and for the world. China has been doing its best for peace and will continue to play a constructive role.

    **中方的立场是客观公允的，同大多数国家的愿望相一致。时间将证明，中方的主张是站在历史正确的一边。**

    China’s position is objective, fair and consistent with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China’s position is on the right side of history.

1. **彭博社记者：中方领导人为何尚未同乌克兰总统泽连斯基接触？是否有相关计划？有报道称双方很快会通话。你可否介绍具体情况？**

   Bloomberg: Why hasn’t the Chinese leader reached out to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine? Is there any plan to do so? The reason why I ask is because there’s been a report that such a call might happen very soon. Do you have any more details on that?

   **汪文斌：目前，中方同有关各方就乌克兰局势保持着顺畅的沟通。**

   Wang Wenbin: China maintains **smooth communication** with relevant sides on the Ukraine situation.

   **中方在乌克兰问题上的立场是一贯、明确的。我们向来从事情本身的是非曲直出发，独立自主作出判断。中方倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，支持各方秉持安全不可分割理念，形成均衡、有效、可持续的欧洲安全架构。中方将继续为推动乌克兰局势缓和发挥建设性作用。**

   China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear. We always make independent judgement based on the merits of the matter itself. China advocates a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We support all parties in following the indivisible security principle and establishing a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture. China will continue to play a constructive role in deescalating the situation in Ukraine.

2. **新华社记者：在疫情仍在全球蔓延的严峻形势下，金砖国家疫苗研发中心昨天举行了线上启动仪式，在携手抗疫的道路上又迈出了坚实一步。你能否介绍相关情况？**

   Xinhua News Agency: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the world. In this grave situation, the launching ceremony for the BRICS Vaccine R&D Center was held online yesterday, marking another solid step forward in fighting the coronavirus together. Could you **brief** us on this?

   > 1. brief：**VERB**（尤指就某项工作或某一重大事件）向…简要介绍情况

   **汪文斌：3月22日，金砖国家疫苗研发中心线上启动仪式暨疫苗合作研讨会成功召开。中国和南非的科技部长，巴西、俄罗斯、印度的卫生部长，金砖五国疫苗研发国别中心负责人以及各国疫苗研发机构的专家等与会，共同见证金砖国家疫苗研发中心的启动，共商金砖国家疫苗研发合作之策。据了解，现阶段各国别中心将积极搭建基于互联网平台的虚拟中心，共同组成金砖国家疫苗研发中心网络，在时机成熟时经综合评估可行性，将启动建立实体中心。**

   Wang Wenbin: On March 22, the online launching ceremony for the BRICS Vaccine R&D Center and workshop on vaccine cooperation was successfully held. Ministers of science and technology from China and South Africa, ministers of health from Brazil, Russia and India, heads of national centers for vaccine R&D from the five BRICS countries, and experts from vaccine R&D institutions attended the event to witness the launching of the Center and discuss ways to promote cooperation among BRICS countries in vaccine research and development. It is learned that at the present stage, the national centers will build Internet-based virtual centers to form a network of BRICS vaccine R&D centers. When conditions are ready, the establishment of physical centers will be started after comprehensive feasibility assessment. 

   **中国是今年金砖国家主席国，将主办金砖国家领导人第十四次会晤，主题是：“构建高质量伙伴关系，共创全球发展新时代”。公共卫生和疫苗合作是今年金砖合作的重点领域之一。当前，疫情仍在全球延宕。金砖国家疫苗研发中心的建立，彰显了金砖五国以疫苗合作为重点，深化公共卫生合作，筑牢抗击疫情“金砖防线”的决心。我们期待，疫苗研发中心能够汇聚金砖五国优势，进一步促进金砖国家间科技合作，提升五国传染病防控能力，为全球抗击疫情贡献“金砖力量”，为推进国际公共卫生合作作出新的贡献。**

   As the BRICS **Chair** for this year, China will host the 14th BRICS Summit under the theme of “Foster High-quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development”. Public health and vaccine cooperation are among the key areas of BRICS cooperation this year. At present, the pandemic is still **dragging on** across the world. The establishment of the BRICS Vaccine R&D Center demonstrates the determination of BRICS countries to focus on vaccine cooperation, deepen public health cooperation and build a “BRICS line of defense” against COVID-19. We hope that the vaccine R&D center will **pool** the strengths of BRICS countries, further promote scientific and technological cooperation among BRICS countries, enhance the five countries’ capability of preventing and controlling infectious diseases, contribute to the global fight against COVID-19 and make new contributions to international public health cooperation.

   I also want to share that the official website for the 14th BRICS Summit (brics2022.mfa.gov.cn) has been launched recently.

3. **路透社记者：消息人士称，美国及其西方盟友正评估俄罗斯是否应继续留在二十国集团内。一位消息人士称，保留俄罗斯成员地位将减弱该集团效力。对于俄罗斯可否留在二十国集团、俄总统普京可否参加今年底在印度尼西亚举办的二十国集团峰会，中方持何立场？**

   Reuters: Sources say the US and its Western allies are assessing whether Russia would remain within the G20 grouping, with one source saying G20 will become a less useful organization if Russia would remain in it. Does China **have a position on** whether Russia can remain in G20 and whether President Putin can attend the G20 summit in Indonesia at the end of this year?

   **汪文斌：二十国集团是国际经济合作主要论坛，汇聚了世界主要经济体，俄罗斯是重要成员。任何成员都没有权利开除其他国家的成员资格。**

   Wang Wenbin: The G20 is the **premier** forum for international economic cooperation. It brings together major economies in the world, including Russia, which is an important member of the group. No member has the right to strip another country of its membership.

   > 1. premier

   **当前，全球抗疫正处于关键阶段，世界经济复苏势头疲弱，不稳定性、不确定性增多。在此背景下，二十国集团在引领全球抗疫、完善全球经济治理、推动世界经济稳定复苏等方面负有重要责任。二十国集团应践行真正的多边主义，加强团结合作，携手应对经济、金融、可持续发展等领域的突出挑战，为实现强劲、绿色、健康的全球发展作出积极贡献。**

   With the global fight against COVID-19 at a critical stage and a struggling world economic recovery **fraught** with rising instability and uncertainties, the G20 **shoulders important responsibilities** in leading global anti-pandemic efforts, improving global economic governance and promoting the steady recovery of the world economy. It should practice true multilateralism, strengthen solidarity and cooperation, jointly deal with prominent challenges in economic, financial, sustainable development and other sectors, and contribute to robust, green and sound global development.

   **中方支持印尼主席国围绕“共同复苏，强劲复苏”的主题，按照既定议程推进二十国集团各领域合作。**

   China supports Indonesia, this year’s President of the G20, in advancing cooperation in various sectors according to the established agenda surrounding the theme of “recover together, recover stronger”.

4. **《北京日报》记者：我们注意到，联合国贸发会议日前发表长篇研究报告，详细梳理改革开放以来，中国在宏观经济、产业升级、国际贸易、数字经济等方面的政策脉络与经验做法，认为中国取得了令人瞩目的经济增长，实现了主要的发展目标，其他发展中国家可以结合自身国情借鉴中国经济结构转型的成功经验。发言人对此有何评论？**

   Beijing Daily: We noticed that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) published a volume of studies **detailing** China’s policy and experience in such areas as “macroeconomic and finance, industrial development, international trade and the digital economy”since its **reform and opening-up**. It says that China has achieved remarkable economic growth and attained its main development targets, and concludes that its structural transformation provides other developing countries with an important learning opportunity that can help them progress **in light of** their own **national realities**. Do you have any comment?

   > 1. detail
   > 2. reform and opening-up

   **汪文斌：我也注意到你提到的相关报告。我们对联合国贸发会议客观全面介绍中国经济结构转型、推动南南合作框架下的政策经验分享、促进发展中国家落实2030年可持续发展议程的积极努力表示赞赏。**

   Wang Wenbin: I have also noted the report you mentioned. We appreciate UNCTAD’s active efforts to present in an objective and comprehensive light China’s economic structural transformation, promote South-South policy experience sharing, and enhance developing countries’ capability to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

   **正如报告指出，从全球范围看，中国是成功推进经济结构转型、特别是工业化转型的范例。中国成功实现经济快速增长，7亿多人口脱贫，三次产业结构显著优化，第一产业占GDP比重已由1990年的27％降至7％左右，第二产业比重稳定在40％左右，服务业占比则由32％增加至54％，数字经济已经成为中国经济新的增长动力。与此同时，中国积极融入全球化，已成为全球价值链、供应链的重要参与者，特别是在疫情中，中国为稳定全球市场供应发挥了重要作用。**

   As the volume points out, China’s successful economic structural transformation, industrial transformation in particular, has been exemplary in the world. China has realized fast economic growth, lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty, and upgraded its industrial structure three times. In 1990, the GDP of the primary industry accounted for 27 percent of the total. The figure has been lowered to around 7 percent. The proportion of the secondary industry remains steadily around 40 percent. Value-added by services as a percentage of the GDP increased from 32 percent to 54 percent. The digital economy has become the new driver of China’s economic growth. At the same time, China has actively integrated into globalization and become an important participant in the global value chains and supply chains. In particular, amid COVID-19, China has played an important role in stabilizing global market supply.

   

   **报告认为，中国改革开放以来的经验表明，高增速与结构转型可以同时实现。虽然中国经验不能被完全复制，但对广大发展中国家来说，仍有许多可资学习借鉴之处。例如，发展中国家可坚持实用、灵活和渐进原则，构建广泛适用、以公共投资为导向的宏观政策体系，保持适度政策灵活性，以更好应对世界经济周期对自身冲击。**

   The volume believes that China’s experience since the beginning of reform and opening-up has shown that high-speed growth and structural transformation can be realized concurrently. While it may not be possible to replicate China’s policy experience, many policy lessons can be helpful for other developing countries. For example, developing countries could follow the principle of pragmatism, flexibility and gradualism, build a macroeconomic policy framework that is public investment-led and flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances, and maintain flexibility to react to shocks from business cycles that emerge in the global economic system.

   

   **近年来，中国坚定不移推动高质量发展，深化改革开放，推进供给侧结构性改革，打造市场化、法治化、国际化营商环境，积极参与区域经济合作，让世界各国共享中国发展新机遇。展望未来，中国经济长期向好的基本面不会改变，经济结构转型升级的红利会持续释放，经济持续健康发展具有多方面有利条件。日前，中国国家统计局公布的今年前两个月国民经济运行数据显示，中国经济发展势头良好，主要经济指标高于预期，展现出强大韧性。**

   In recent years, we have firmly promoted high-quality development, deepened reform and opening-up, advanced supply-side structural reform, built a business environment that is based on market principles and rule of law and up to international standards, actively participated in regional economic cooperation and shared China’s new development opportunities with the rest of the world. Looking ahead, the fundamentals sustaining China’s long-term economic growth will remain unchanged, the dividends of economic structural transformation and upgrading will continue to be unleashed, and there will be many enabling conditions for the Chinese economy’s sustained and sound development. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China show that from January to February China’s economic development enjoyed sound momentum with major economic indicators at higher levels than expected, which demonstrates strong resilience. 

   

   **中方愿同各方加强沟通合作，共同营造有利于世界经济稳定复苏的良好环境，为世界经济稳定、健康、可持续发展注入更多正能量。**

   China is ready to enhance communication and cooperation with all sides to jointly foster an enabling environment for the steady recovery of the world economy and inject more positive energy into its stable, sound and sustainable development.

5. **彭博社记者：有知情人士表示，王毅国务委员兼外长预计将于周五访问印度。外交部可否证实并介绍更多情况？**

   Bloomberg: State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is expected to visit India on Friday, according to one person familiar with the matter. Can the foreign ministry confirm this and provide additional details? 

   **汪文斌：关于你提到的问题，我目前没有可以发布的消息。**

   Wang Wenbin: I don’t have any information to release at the moment.

6. **深圳卫视记者：本周是2022年“澜湄周”。2016年3月23日，澜沧江—湄公河合作首次领导人会议在海南三亚举行，正式启动这一新型次区域合作机制。今天是澜湄合作启动六周年。中方如何评价澜湄合作进展？对澜湄合作未来发展有什么期待？**

   Shenzhen TV: This week we observe the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Week of 2022. On March 23, 2016, the LMC, a new-type sub-regional cooperation mechanism, was officially launched at the First LMC Leaders’ Meeting in Sanya, Hainan. Today marks the sixth anniversary of the LMC. How do you comment on the progress of the LMC? What expectations does China have for the LMC going forward?

   **汪文斌：正如你所说，澜湄合作是首个由流域各国共商共建共享的新型次区域合作机制。在六国共同努力下，澜湄合作在短短6年时间里迅速发展壮大，合作领域不断拓宽，参与部门日益增多，内生动力持续增强，已成为最具活力和发展潜力的次区域合作机制，为各国发展注入了“源头活水”，为构建人类命运共同体树立了典范。**

   Wang Wenbin: As you noted, the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) is a new-type sub-regional cooperation mechanism featuring extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits among the riparian states. With the concerted efforts of the six countries, the LMC has achieved rapid development over the past six years with a wider range of cooperation fields, more participating departments and growing endogenous driving force. It has become the most dynamic sub-regional cooperation mechanism with the strongest potential, which has injected impetus into the development of various countries and set an example for the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. 

   

   **去年以来，在新冠肺炎疫情延宕反复、世界经济复苏乏力的背景下，澜湄合作持续高水平发展。六国在中国重庆成功举办澜湄合作第六次外长会，王毅国务委员兼外长和湄公河五国外长一致同意，将在更宽领域、更深层次推进各领域合作，开启澜湄合作新的“金色五年”。六国各层级保持密切往来，抗疫合作成就斐然，线上线下交流活跃，成功举办了首次澜湄旅游城市合作联盟大会、首届澜湄地方政府合作论坛、第二届澜湄水资源合作论坛等丰富多彩的活动。2021年中国同湄公河五国贸易额近4000亿美元，同比增长约23％，为促进各国经济复苏和区域繁荣振兴作出了积极贡献。**

   Since last year, amid the flare-ups of COVID-19 and the sluggish world economic recovery, the LMC has continued to maintain high-level development. During the sixth LMC Foreign Ministers’ Meeting held in Chongqing, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the foreign ministers of the five Mekong countries agreed to deepen cross-board cooperation in a wider range of areas and usher in another “Golden Five Years” of the LMC. The six countries have maintained close exchanges at various levels, achieved fruitful outcomes in anti-epidemic cooperation and had active interactions both online and offline. We have successfully held a variety of activities including the first Lancang-Mekong Tourist Cities Cooperation Alliance Conference, the first Forum on Lancang-Mekong Local Government Cooperation and the second Lancang-Mekong Water Resources Cooperation Forum. In 2021, trade between China and the five Mekong countries reached nearly $400 billion, registering an increase of around 23 percent and making positive contributions to promoting the economic recovery of the countries and prosperity and revitalization of the region.

   

   **澜湄六国是山水相连的近邻，更是天然的合作伙伴。中方将积极贯彻落实习近平外交思想和亲诚惠容的周边外交理念，同湄公河国家携手努力，进一步深化睦邻友好和务实合作，积极构建澜湄流域经济发展带，持续建设澜湄国家命运共同体，为次区域各国人民创造更加美好的未来。**

   The six LMC countries are close neighbors connected by mountains and rivers and natural cooperation partners. China will actively act on the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and pursue neighborhood diplomacy featuring amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, work together with the Mekong countries to deepen good neighborliness and practical cooperation, actively build the Lancang-Mekong Economic Development Belt, continue to foster a community with a shared future of the Lancang-Mekong countries, and create a better future for people of all countries in the sub-region.

   

   **在今年“澜湄周”期间，中方20余个中央单位和10多个地方省市将举办青年交流、智库论坛、影视展播、乡村振兴等80多项丰富多彩的活动，与湄公河五国一道，共同庆祝澜湄合作启动六周年。欢迎媒体朋友持续关注。**

   During the LMC Week this year, more than 20 central government agencies and over 10 provinces and cities on the Chinese side will hold over 80 diverse activities including youth exchanges, forums of think tanks, movie shows and events on rural revitalization. In this way, we will celebrate with the five Mekong countries the sixth anniversary of the launch of the LMC. You are most welcome to follow them.

7. **印度报业托拉斯记者：关于你刚才提到的金砖国家疫苗研发中心，请问中心总部会设在某一金砖成员国吗？还是由五国各自运营并保持高效沟通？**

   PTI: Further to what you said about the BRICS vaccine research center. Eventually, where will it be located? Will it be headquartered in one of the five countries or function just as they are from different countries with effective communication?

   **汪文斌：刚才我已经介绍过，现阶段各国别中心将积极搭建基于互联网平台的虚拟中心，共同组成金砖国家疫苗研发中心网络。时机成熟时，各方会共同评估、作出决定。**

   Wang Wenbin: As I said earlier, at the present stage, the national centers will actively build virtual centers based on Internet platforms to form a network of BRICS vaccine R&D centers. All parties will conduct joint assessment and make decisions when conditions are ready.

8. **总台央视记者：22日，王毅国务委员兼外长出席伊斯兰合作组织外长会开幕式并发表致辞。我们注意到，这是中国外长首次出席伊斯兰合作组织外长会。中方举动有何特殊意义？计划如何推进同伊斯兰国家的关系？**

   CCTV: On March 22, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended and addressed the opening ceremony of the 48th session of the Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). We noticed this is the first time for a Chinese foreign minister to participate in the OIC-CFM meeting. Does this have any special significance? How does China plan to advance relations with Islamic countries? 

   **汪文斌：昨天，王毅国务委员兼外长在伊斯兰堡应邀出席伊斯兰合作组织外长理事会第48次会议开幕式并发表致辞。这是中国外长首次参加伊斯兰合作组织外长会，充分体现了中国和伊斯兰世界加强交流合作的真诚愿望，体现了双方关系的不断发展和彼此互信的进一步深化，必将推动双方关系迈上新台阶。**

   Wang Wenbin: Yesterday, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended and addressed the opening ceremony of the 48th session of the CFM of the OIC in Islamabad upon invitation. This is the first time for a Chinese foreign minister to participate in the OIC-CFM meeting. It demonstrates China and the Islamic world’s sincere wish to strengthen exchange and cooperation as well as the two sides’ growing relations and deepening mutual trust. It will surely help bring relations to a new height.

   

   **王毅国务委员在致辞中表示，中国同伊斯兰世界交往延绵千年，历经国际风云变幻的考验，有着深厚的历史底蕴和坚实的民意基础。双方交往秉持三个始终坚持，即始终坚持互尊互信，支持对方核心关切；始终坚持团结互助，致力实现共同发展；始终坚持互学互鉴，守护世界多样文明。**

   State Councilor Wang Yi pointed out in his speech that the exchanges between the two sides, which have lasted for thousands of years and withstood the test of international changes, have a profound historical heritage and a solid foundation of popular support. The two sides always respect and trust each other and support respective core concerns; always stand in solidarity with mutual assistance and strive for common development; always learn from each other and act as guardians for diversity of civilizations in the world.

   

   **王毅国务委员指出，中国愿同伊斯兰国家建设四个伙伴关系。一要做团结协作的伙伴。坚定支持彼此捍卫国家的主权、独立和领土完整，坚定支持彼此独立自主地探索符合本国国情的发展道路，坚定支持彼此维护自身正当发展权益和广大发展中国家的共同利益。二要做发展振兴的伙伴。继续团结抗疫，下阶段中方将再向伊斯兰国家提供3亿剂疫苗。继续加强发展战略对接，以高质量共建“一带一路”和携手落实全球发展倡议为“双引擎”，巩固传统合作，培育新兴亮点，助力中伊发展振兴，引领南南合作潮流。三要做安全稳定的伙伴。中方将继续支持伊斯兰国家运用伊斯兰智慧解决当代热点问题，把维稳促和的钥匙牢牢掌握在自己手中，促进巴勒斯坦问题的全面公正解决，支持阿富汗实现包容建政、稳健治理，开启和平重建新篇章，支持俄罗斯和乌克兰继续和谈，谈出停火，谈出止战，谈出和平，防止发生人道主义灾难，避免乌克兰危机外溢。四要做文明互鉴的伙伴。弘扬和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由的全人类共同价值，反对以意识形态划线制造分裂对抗，反对“文明优越论”“文明冲突论”，反对对非西方文明的歪曲抹黑，反对将恐怖主义同特定民族宗教挂钩，深化预防性反恐和去极端化合作，抵制反恐“双重标准”。王毅国务委员兼外长的致辞得到与会各方的积极响应。**

   State Councilor Wang Yi pointed out that China would like to develop a partnership with Islamic countries in four aspects. First, solidarity and coordination. We will firmly support each other in defending national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, in independently seeking a development path consistent with national realities, and in safeguarding each other’s legitimate development rights and interests as well as the vast developing world’s common interests. Second, development and revitalization. We will continue to stand with each other in the fight against COVID-19. China will provide 300 million more doses of vaccines to Islamic countries. We will further dovetail our development strategies and make full use of the twin engines of high quality BRI development and GDI cooperation to consolidate traditional cooperation and foster new highlights to boost shared development and revitalization and spearhead South-South cooperation. Third, security and stability. China will continue to support the Islamic countries in drawing on Islamic wisdom to resolve hotspot issues, taking the key to maintaining stability and promoting peace firmly in their own hands, and facilitating a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian issue. We support Afghanistan in establishing an inclusive political structure, exercising moderate governance, and writing a new chapter of peace and reconstruction. We support Russia and Ukraine in keeping up peace talks to cease hostilities, end the fighting, bring peace, avert a humanitarian disaster, and prevent the Ukraine crisis from spilling over. Fourth, mutual learning of civilizations. We will uphold peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are values shared by all humanity. We will oppose acts that create division and confrontation based on ideology, oppose theories on superiority of certain civilizations or clash of civilizations, and oppose misrepresentation and denigration of non-Western civilizations. We will oppose linking terrorism with specific ethnic or religious groups, deepen preventive counter-terrorism and deradicalization cooperation, and reject double standard on combating terrorism. State Councilor Wang’s remarks elicited positive responses from others attending the session.

   

   **与会期间，王毅国务委员兼外长还会见了伊斯兰合作组织秘书长塔哈以及埃及外长舒克里、索马里外长阿卜迪赛义德等与会国家外长。中方表示支持伊斯兰国家维护主权、独立和领土完整，探索符合自身国情的发展道路，愿继续同广大伊斯兰国家坚定站在一起，维护双方正当权利，扩大双方在国际上的共同声音，增强双方在国际社会中的正能量。塔哈表示，中国外长出席伊斯兰合作组织外长会将进一步提振双方关系。伊合组织愿同中方加强政治磋商，拓展交往渠道，深化经贸、金融、人文、文明对话等交流合作，为双方人民带来更多利好。**

   Besides attending the session, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi also met with OIC Secretary-General Hussein Ibrahim Taha and foreign ministers attending the session including Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and Somali Foreign Minister Abdisaid Muse Ali. The Chinese side expressed its support for Islamic countries in safeguarding sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and seeking development paths suited to their own national conditions. China will continue to stand firmly with the vast number of Islamic countries, safeguard the two sides’ legitimate development rights, expand common voice in the international community, and enhance positive energy in the international community. Secretary-General Taha said that the presence of Chinese foreign minister at the session will further boost bilateral relations. The OIC is ready to strengthen political consultation with China, expand channels for exchanges, and deepen exchanges and cooperation in such fields as economy and trade, finance, people-to-people and cultural affairs, and inter-civilizational dialogue, thus bringing more benefits to the two peoples.

9. **彭博社记者：据报道，在与中国的紧张关系加剧之际，美国和菲律宾将举行30年来最大规模的军事演习。外交部对此有何评论？**

   Bloomberg: The US and the Philippines will hold their biggest military drills in around three decades. This comes as the tension with China rises. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on the military drills to be held by the US and the Philippines?

   **汪文斌：我们不反对有关国家在其境内举行军事演习，但希望演习不要针对第三方，不要做有损地区和平与稳定的事。我还想强调的是，中菲之间不存在紧张关系，希望有关方面不要人为制造紧张。**

   Wang Wenbin: We do not oppose relevant countries’ military drills within their borders, but we hope the exercises will not target any third party and they will not do things detrimental to regional peace and stability. I would also like to stress that there is no tension between China and the Philippines. We hope relevant sides will not create tension.

10. **彭博社记者：台湾“总统”蔡英文周二晚与日本前首相安倍晋三视频通话，双方谈及新冠肺炎疫情、乌克兰、《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》（CPTPP）、印太地区和平等议题。外交部对此有何评论？**

    Bloomberg: Just a question on a virtual call between former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Tuesday evening where they discussed various topics, including COVID, Ukraine, the CPTPP and peace in the Indo-Pacific region. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on this virtual meeting?

    **汪文斌：首先，我要纠正你的说法，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。台湾地区没有什么“总统”。中方坚决反对建交国同台湾进行任何形式的官方往来，坚决反对台湾地区加入任何官方性质的协议和组织。这一立场是一贯的、明确的。**

    Wang Wenbin: First of all, I must correct you on one point. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory and there is no “president” whatsoever of the Taiwan region. China firmly opposes any official interaction between Taiwan and countries having diplomatic ties with China and the Taiwan region’s accession to any agreement or organization of official nature. This is our consistent and clear-cut position. 

    **日本曾对台湾殖民统治长达半个世纪，犯下罄竹难书的罪行，对中国人民负有严重历史罪责。日本国内部分政治势力公然与“台独”势力勾结，在台湾问题上指手画脚。中方对此表示坚决反对和强烈不满，已向日方提出严正交涉。**

    During its colonial rule over Taiwan for half a century, Japan committed innumerable crimes, over which it bears grave historical responsibilities to the Chinese people. Some political forces in Japan openly colluded with “Taiwan independence” forces and made wanton remarks on the Taiwan question. China rejects and deplores such moves and has lodged solemn representation with the Japanese side.

    **台湾问题与乌克兰问题有着本质区别，没有任何可比性。台湾是中国的事，不关日本的事。日本国内一些人将台湾与乌克兰相提并论，鼓动在对台关系上搞突破的动向是危险的，也是徒劳的。我们严肃敦促日方和个别政客深刻反省历史，切实遵守中日四个政治文件原则和迄今承诺，不与台湾当局进行任何官方往来，不为“台独”分子撑腰打气，在台湾问题上谨言慎行，停止挑衅滋事。**

    The Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue are different in nature and are not comparable at all. The Taiwan question is purely China’s own affair and none of Japan’s business. It is dangerous and futile for some people in Japan to mention Taiwan and Ukraine in the same breath and incite “breakthroughs” in the relations with Taiwan. We seriously urge the Japanese side and certain politicians to make deep reflection on history, earnestly abide by the principles stipulated in the four political documents between China and Japan and Japan's commitments, avoid any official interaction with the Taiwan authorities, refrain from emboldening “Taiwan independence” elements, speak and act prudently on the Taiwan question and stop making provocations.

    **我们也注意到，乌克兰危机爆发以来，民进党当局借机操弄话题，蛊惑人心，为“台独”主张张目，这纯属枉费心机。无论民进党当局耍什么花招，都改变不了台湾是中国一部分的事实，阻挡不了台湾必将回归祖国的大势，也挽救不了“台独”势力终将覆灭的结局。**

    We have also noted that since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the DPP authorities have manipulated the issue to sway public opinion and embolden “Taiwan independence” propositions. Such moves are futile. No matter what trick the DPP authorities play, the fact that Taiwan is part of China can never be changed, the overriding trend of Taiwan being reunited with the motherland can never be held back, and the defeat of “Taiwan independence” forces can never be reversed.

11. **《北京青年报》记者：据报道，3月22日，国家体育总局局长、中国奥委会主席苟仲文以视频形式会见了美国奥委会主席莱恩斯，并接受了美国奥委会赠予的荣誉奖杯。发言人对此有何评论？**

    Beijing Youth Daily: According to reports, on March 22, Gou Zhongwen, Director of the General Administration of Sport of China and President of Chinese Olympic Committee, met with Susanne Lyons, President of US Olympic Committee, via videolink. He also received an honorary trophy from the US side. Do you have any comment?

    **汪文斌：我注意到有关报道。一段时间以来，中方同包括美国奥委会在内的各国体育部门、组织和机构保持密切沟通与合作，共同向世界呈现了一届简约、安全、精彩的冬奥盛会，赢得国际社会广泛赞誉。**

    Wang Wenbin: I noted relevant reports. For a period of time, the Chinese side has maintained close communication and cooperation with sports departments, organizations and institutions of various countries, the US Olympic Committee included, and jointly presented a streamlined, safe and splendid Winter Olympics to the world, winning wide acclaim from the international community. 

    **北京冬奥会、冬残奥会期间，中美运动员在赛场上同场竞技，赛场下友好交流，结下了真诚的友谊。中方还接受了美国奥委会向北京冬奥组委主席蔡奇赠予的荣誉奖杯。这些都表明，加强中美体育人文交流合乎民意、顺应民心，符合中美双方共同利益。希望中美双方相向而行，继续推进人文交流合作，增进两国人民相互理解，为中美关系健康发展厚植民意基础。**

    During the Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, Chinese and American athletes competed with each other and also had friendly interactions, fostering sincere friendship. Also, the Chinese side received an honorary trophy given by the US Olympic Committee to Cai Qi, President of the Beijing Organising Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. All this shows that enhancing sports and people-to-people exchanges between China and the US meets the people’s aspiration and serves the common interests of both sides. We hope that the two sides will work together to continuously advance cultural and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation, enhance mutual understanding between the two peoples, and cement public support for the sound development of China-US relations.

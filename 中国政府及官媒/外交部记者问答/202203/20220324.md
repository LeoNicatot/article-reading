2. **路透社记者：美国运输部长皮特·布蒂吉格周三表示，中方已邀请美国家运输安全委员会参与东航客机事故调查。外交部对此有何评论？**

   Reuters: US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Wednesday that the Chinese authorities had invited the US National Transportation Safety Board to take part in the investigation of the crash. Could you give any comment from the Chinese Foreign Ministry on that?

   **汪文斌：目前中方正在全力开展东航失事客机的搜寻与救援工作。中方将按照《国际民航公约》及其附件以及中国民航法律法规开展事故调查，并与相关方保持密切联系。**

   Wang Wenbin: The Chinese side has been **sparing no effort to** conduct search and rescue efforts after the China Eastern Airlines **passenger plane** crash. We will conduct investigations according to **the Convention on International Civil Aviation**, its Annexes and Chinese civil aviation **laws and regulations** and maintain close contact with **all parties concerned**.

3. **韩联社记者：据报道，今天朝鲜发射了新型弹道导弹，系今年第11次射导。日本首相岸田文雄对此表达关切，随后朝鲜发文指责日本。中方对此有何评论？**

   Yonhap News Agency: According to reports, the DPRK fired a new type of **ballistic** missile today, which is its 11th missile launch this year. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida **expressed concern over** it and the DPRK criticized Japan in an article. Does China have any comment?

   > 1. ballistic[bəˈlɪstɪk]：**ADJ**弹道（学）的

   **汪文斌：我们注意到有关报道。希望有关各方着眼半岛和平稳定大局，坚持对话协商的正确方向，共同致力于推进半岛问题政治解决进程。**

   Wang Wenbin: We have **taken note of** relevant reports. We hope all sides will bear in mind the overall interest of peace and stability on the Korean **Peninsula**, adhere to the right direction of dialogue and **consultation**, and jointly advance the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.

   > 1. Peninsula[pəˈnɪnsjələ]：**N-COUNT**半岛
   > 2. consultation[ˌkɒnslˈteɪʃn]：**N-VAR**商讨会;研讨;磋商

4. **总台央视记者：不久前，中国网络安全企业360公司发布了《网络战序幕：美国国安局NSA（APT-C-40）对全球发起长达十余年无差别攻击》报告。日前，360公司完整披露了报告中提及的NSA针对中国境内目标的代表性网络武器——量子攻击平台的技术特点。发言人对此是否有进一步评论？**

   CCTV: Previously, the Chinese **cybersecurity** company named 360 released the report on indiscriminate cyberattack across the world launched by the APT-C-40 group of the US National Security Agency (NSA) over the past decade or so. The company recently disclosed **in full** the technical features of “Quantum”, the most powerful cyber weapon used by the NSA to attack targets in China mentioned in the report. Do you have any further comment?

   > 1. in full：**PHRASE**所有地;全部地;全数地
   >
   >    You say that something has been done or described **in full** when everything that was necessary has been done or described.

   **汪文斌：我注意到相关报告。这个报告披露的内容显示，量子攻击是美国国家安全局针对国家级互联网专门设计的一种先进的网络流量劫持攻击技术。美方可以利用这一技术，对世界各国访问推特、油管、亚马逊等美国网站的所有互联网用户发起网络攻击，中国的社交软件也是攻击目标。这意味着无论你是谁，无论你在世界哪个角落，只要你使用网络社交平台，背后都可能有个“老大”在盯着你。**

   Wang Wenbin: I noted relevant reports. The latest revelation shows that “Quantum” is an advanced cyber hijacking tool that the NSA has specially designed for attacking state-level Internet. The US can use this technology to attack all Internet users browsing US websites such as Twitter, YouTube, Amazon as well as Chinese social media applications. This means no matter who you are and where you are, Big Brother is probably watching you whenever you log on to a social media platform. 

   **近年来，美方宣称构建所谓的“清洁网络”，酝酿成立所谓“未来互联网联盟”，以提升网络安全防范能力为由同多国加强网络安全合作。这次360公司的报告指出，许多与美国有合作的国家同样也是美国网络攻击的目标。此前曝出的“脏盒”“棱镜门”“怒角计划”“电幕行动”等美国网络监控和攻击内幕也表明，连美国的盟友、伙伴都在美国的严密监控之列。可见，所谓的“清洁网络”不过是美方为方便其全球监控窃密摆下的“迷魂阵”，是“黑客帝国”为自己披上的“隐身衣”。**

   In recent years, the US has proposed to build the so-called “Clean Network”, has been brewing the so-called “Alliance for the Future of the Internet”, and has used cyber capacity building as a pretext to strengthen cybersecurity cooperation with many countries. However, as the report reveals, many countries the US works with are also targets of its cyberattacks. As we can see from exposed operations such as “Dirtbox”, “PRISM”, “Irritant Horn” and “Telescreen”, the US doesn’t even **spare** its allies and partners in its global cyber surveillance and attacks. In this sense, the so-called “Clean Network” is nothing but a **mirage** to **camouflage** US surveillance and cyber theft across the globe and an “invisibility cloak” to conceal its true face as the “empire of hacking”. 

   > 1. spare：**VERB**使免遭伤害;使幸免
   >
   >    If a person or a place **is spared**, they are not harmed, even though other people or places have been.

   **我们再次敦促美方在网络空间做一个负责任的国家，停止针对中国和全球的网络窃密和攻击。美方要求别国遵守的规则，自己首先应当遵守。**

   We once again urge the US to act responsibly in cyberspace and stop cyber theft and attacks on China and the rest of the world. The US should **implement** the framework that it insists all other states abide by.

   > 1. implement：**VERB**履行;实施

5. **法新社记者：第一个问题，本月底中国将主办阿富汗邻国外长会，请问哪些国家将受邀与会？是否邀请印度参会？第二个问题，北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格指责中国“通过公然散布谎言和虚假信息”为俄罗斯提供政治支持。他还对中国可能为俄罗斯侵略乌克兰提供物质支持表示关切。外交部对此有何评论？**

   AFP: I have two questions. Which countries will participate in the meeting of Afghanistan’s neighbors to be hosted by Beijing later this month? Will India be invited? And the second question is, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has accused China of giving political backing to Russia as it attacks Ukraine by “spreading **blatant** lies and misinformation”. He has also expressed concerns that China could provide material support for the Russian invasion. How does the Chinese Foreign Ministry view these comments?

   > 1. blatant[ˈbleɪtnt]：**ADJ-GRADED**公然的；露骨的；明目张胆的
   >
   >    You use **blatant** to describe something bad that is done in an open or very obvious way.

   **汪文斌：关于第一个问题，我们正在加紧筹备第三次阿富汗邻国外长会，愿继续为阿富汗长治久安发挥邻国优势，贡献邻国力量。至于你提到的具体问题，中方会适时发布相关消息。**

   Wang Wenbin: On your first question, we are speeding up preparations for the third Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan. As Afghanistan’s neighbor, China stands ready to **leverage** its strength and contribute to the country’s lasting stability and security. With regard to your question about the specifics, we will release information **in due course**.

   > 1. in due course：**PHRASE**在适当的时候;到一定的时候
   >
   >    If you say that something will happen or take place **in due course**, you mean that you cannot make it happen any quicker and it will happen when the time is right for it.

   **关于第二个问题，指责中方散布涉乌虚假信息，本身就是在散布虚假信息。**

   On your second question, accusing China of spreading misinformation related to Ukraine is in itself disinformation. 

   **中方始终本着客观公正的态度，为早日实现停火止战、避免人道主义危机、恢复和平稳定作出积极努力。我们一贯主张，乌克兰应当成为东西方沟通的桥梁，而不应成为大国博弈的前沿。欧洲各国应当秉持战略自主原则，同包括俄乌在内的相关国家一道，本着安全不可分割精神，通过对话谈判构建均衡、有效、可持续的欧洲安全架构。美国和北约也应当同俄开展对话，解开乌克兰危机背后的症结。**

   With an objective and just attitude, China has been working actively toward realizing **cessation** of hostilities as soon as possible, averting a humanitarian crisis and restoring peace and stability. We have always maintained that Ukraine should be a bridge for communication between the East and the West, not an **outpost** in major power rivalry. European countries should **uphold** the principle of **strategic autonomy** and work with Russia, Ukraine and other countries concerned to build a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture through dialogue and negotiation following the spirit of indivisible security. The US and NATO should also engage in dialogue with Russia to address the root cause of the Ukraine crisis.

   > 1. cessation[ seˈseɪʃn]：**N-UNCOUNT**停止;终止
   > 2. outpost：**N-COUNT**贸易站；前哨基地；（设在国外的）军事基地
   > 3. uphold：**VERB**拥护；支持；维护

   **化解危机，需要的是冷静理性，而不是点火浇油。恢复和平，需要的是对话沟通，而不是施压胁迫。实现长治久安，需要的是照顾各方合理安全关切，而不是推行集团对抗、谋求绝对安全。**

   What is needed to resolve the crisis is **a cool head and a rational mind**, not adding fuel to the fire. What is needed to restore peace is dialogue and communication, not pressure or **coercion**. What is needed to achieve lasting peace and stability is efforts to accommodate the legitimate security concerns of all parties, not moves to seek **bloc** confrontation and absolute security. 

   > 1. coercion：**N-UNCOUNT**强迫;胁迫;逼迫
   >
   > 2. bloc：**N-COUNT**国家集团；阵营；共同体
   >
   >    - ...the former Soviet bloc.
   >
   >      前苏联集团

   **中方的立场同大多数国家的愿望相一致。时间将证明，中方的主张是站在历史正确的一边，任何对中方的无端指责和猜忌都将不攻自破。**

   China’s position is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China’s position is on the right side of history, and all groundless accusations and suspicions against China are indefensible and will simply collapse.

6. **《澳门月刊》记者：美国国务院表示，中国一直在散布虚假信息，这些虚假信息首先来自莫斯科，包括关于各种生物武器计划。你对此有何评论？**

   Macau Monthly: The US Department of State claimed that China has been spreading disinformation that has **in the first instance** come from Moscow, including about various biological weapons programs. Do you have any comment?

   > 1. in the first instance：**PHRASE**首先;第一步
   >
   >    You say **in the first instance** to mention something that is the first step in a series of actions.

   **汪文斌：一段时间以来，我们看到国际社会围绕美国在乌克兰生物实验室的讨论十分热烈，提出了很多疑问。但我们遗憾地看到，美方作出的回应存在诸多漏洞，各方完全有理由质疑。美方不能只是用沉默和一句“虚假信息”来搪塞。究竟是不是虚假信息，这需要美方作出严肃的澄清。**

   Wang Wenbin: For some time now, the international community has had intense discussions on the US biolabs in Ukraine and raised many doubts. Regrettably, the US has given nothing but a deeply flawed response. All sides have every reason to question it. The US cannot **muddle** through by **clamming up** or **dismissing** it all as “disinformation”. The US needs to offer serious clarifications on whether it is disinformation or not.

   > 1. muddle：**VERB**搞混;弄乱
   > 2. clam up：**PHRASAL VERB**(常因害羞或避免说漏嘴)不再开口，闭口不言
   > 3. dismiss：**VERB**不考虑;不理会

   **美方在乌克兰生物实验室的研究目的究竟何在？美方是否在乌克兰和其他境外实验室从事美国内禁止的危险研究？国际社会对这些问题都有重大关切。**

   What is the purpose of US research in Ukraine-based biolabs? Has the US conducted dangerous research banned at home in labs overseas including in Ukraine? The international community has major concerns over these issues.

   **美方自证清白的最好办法就是敞开大门，接受国际社会的检验。我们敦促美方改弦更张，尽快就其在乌克兰和全球的生物军事活动作出令人信服的交代，并停止独家阻挠建立《禁止生物武器公约》核查机制。**

   The best way for the US to prove its innocence is to open up for international scrutiny. We urge the US to **change its course**, promptly give a convincing explanation for its biomilitary activities in Ukraine and other places around the globe and stop standing alone in opposing the establishment of a BWC verification mechanism.

7. **路透社记者：美国贸易代表办公室周三宣布，重新豁免对352项从中国进口商品的关税，这少于此前考虑重新豁免的549项中国进口商品。外交部对此有何评论？**

   Reuters: The US Trade Representative’s Office said on Wednesday that it has **reinstated** 352 **expired** product exclusions from US “Section 301” **tariffs** on Chinese imports. This is **well short of** the 549 exclusions that it was previously considering. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on this?

   > 1. reinstate：**VERB**恢复(法律、做法等);修复（设施等）
   >
   > 2. tariff：**N-COUNT**(政府对进口商品征收的)关税
   >
   > 3. short of：**ADJ**少于;不及;未达到
   >
   >    If someone or something is or stops **short of** a place, they have not quite reached it. If they are or fall **short of** an amount, they have not quite achieved it.

   **汪文斌：我们注意到相关报道，具体问题请你向主管部门询问。作为原则，中方一贯认为，中美经贸关系的本质是互利共赢，贸易战没有赢家。**

   Wang Wenbin: We have taken note of relevant reports. I would refer you to the **competent authorities** for this question. In principle, it is China’s consistent view that China-US economic and trade relations are mutually-beneficial and all-win in nature and no one wins in a trade war.

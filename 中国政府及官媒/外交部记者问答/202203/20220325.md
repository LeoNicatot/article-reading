1. **彭博社记者：俄罗斯方面表示，俄外长拉夫罗夫将于3月31日赴北京出席阿富汗邻国外长会。会议是否将讨论乌克兰局势？中方是否将以此为契机推动俄乌停火和保护平民？**

   Bloomberg: Russia says Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is coming to Beijing for a meeting to discuss Afghanistan on March 31. During that meeting, will there be an opportunity to discuss **the situation in Ukraine**? And will that be an opportunity for China to **push for** a ceasefire and protection of civilians in Ukraine?

   **汪文斌：我们正加紧筹备第三次阿富汗邻国外长会，愿继续为阿富汗长治久安发挥邻国优势，贡献邻国力量。具体情况我们会适时发布消息。**

   Wang Wenbin: We are speeding up preparations for the third Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan. China will continue to leverage its strength as a neighbor of Afghanistan and contribute to its lasting peace and stability. More information about the meeting will be released in due course.

2. **总台国广记者：24日，王毅国务委员兼外长访问了阿富汗。发言人能否进一步介绍访问情况？**

   CRI: On March 24, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi paid a visit to Afghanistan. Could you tell us more about that?

   **汪文斌：昨天，王毅国务委员兼外长访问了阿富汗，分别同阿富汗临时政府代理副总理巴拉达尔、代理外长穆塔基举行会谈。这是去年阿富汗政局变动之后，中国外长首次访阿，对于促进阿和平重建、维护地区和平稳定具有重要意义，将产生积极影响。**

   Wang Wenbin: Yesterday, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi paid a visit to Afghanistan, during which he held talks with **Acting** Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi of the Afghan **interim** government. This is the first visit by the Chinese foreign minister since the change of government in Afghanistan last year. The visit is of great significance as it will have a positive effect on promoting peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan and upholding peace and stability in the region.

   > 2. interim

   **王毅国务委员兼外长在会谈中表示，中阿是山水相连的友好邻邦，两国有着上千年交往历史。中国尊重阿富汗独立、主权和领土完整，尊重阿富汗人民作出的自主选择，尊重阿富汗的宗教信仰和民族习惯。中方从不干涉阿内政，从不在阿谋求任何私利，从不寻求所谓势力范围。正如阿富汗朋友所常说的那样，中国是唯一没有伤害过阿富汗的大国。中方愿赓续两国人民的传统友谊，在和平共处五项原则基础上，同阿富汗发展正常友好的邻国关系，助力阿实现真正独立和自主发展，把阿富汗的前途命运掌握在自己手中。希望阿临时政府包容建政，稳健施政，继续朝着符合阿人民利益和国际社会期待的方向作出积极努力。王毅国务委员兼外长强调，“东伊运”是被联合国安理会列名和中国政府依法认定的恐怖组织，希望阿方切实履行承诺，采取有效措施坚决打击包括“东伊运”在内的一切恐怖势力。**

   State Councilor Wang Yi noted during the talks that China and Afghanistan are friendly neighbors connected by mountains and rivers with bilateral exchanges dating back over a thousand years. China respects Afghanistan’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, respects the independent choices made by the Afghan people and respects the religious belief and ethnic custom of the Afghan people. China does not interfere in Afghanistan’s internal affairs, nor does it **seek self-interest or sphere of influence** in Afghanistan. As our Afghan friends often say, China is the only major country that has never hurt Afghanistan. China is ready to carry forward the traditional friendship between the two peoples and develop normal and friendly neighborly relations with Afghanistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, in an effort to help the country achieve true independence and **endogenous** development and take its future firmly in its own hands. It is hoped that the Afghan interim government can establish an **inclusive** political framework, adopt **prudent** policies and make positive efforts in line with the Afghan people’s interests and the international community’s expectations. State Councilor Wang stressed that the ETIM is a terrorist organization listed by the UN Security Council and **designated** by the Chinese government in accordance with law. We hope Afghanistan can earnestly fulfill its commitments and take effective measures to **resolutely** combat the ETIM and all other terrorist forces.

   **阿方欢迎王毅国务委员兼外长和中国代表团访阿，表示这是阿方接待的最重要高级代表团，将进一步增进阿中历史悠久的友好关系。阿方感谢中方为阿方提供宝贵帮助，特别是雪中送炭，为阿人民提供急需的越冬人道物资。阿方强调，阿塔是负责任的政府，愿向中国和全世界重申，决不允许任何恐怖分子在阿活动，决不允许任何人、任何机构利用阿领土采取针对别国的行动，更不允许任何势力从事破坏中国的行动。阿方重视中方安全关切，将采取切实、强有力举措，实现阿全境安全，并为维护地区安全作出贡献。阿方高度赞赏中国驻阿使馆一直在阿坚守，这充分体现了阿中之间强有力的联系。阿方珍视同中方的友谊，赞赏中方在阿富汗人民最困难时伸出援手，特别是提供抗疫支持和阿迫切需要的人道主义援助。阿愿发挥独特地域优势，更充分参与共建“一带一路”，成为地区互联互通的桥梁。**

   The Afghan side welcomed the visit by the Chinese **delegation** led by State Councilor Wang Yi, noting that this visit by the most important high-level delegation it had received will further strengthen the **time-honored** friendship between Afghanistan and China. The Afghan side thanked China for its valuable assistance, especially the much-needed humanitarian winter supplies for the Afghan people. The Afghan side stressed that the Afghan Taliban is a responsible government and would like to reiterate to China and the rest of the world that it will never allow activities by any terrorist in Afghanistan; it will never allow anyone or any organization to use the Afghan territory to conduct actions targeting other countries; and it will never allow any force to engage in activities detrimental to China. The Afghan side attaches importance to China’s security concerns and will take concrete and robust measures to ensure safety in the whole of Afghanistan and contribute to regional security. The Afghan side expressed high appreciation for the Chinese embassy’s uninterrupted operation in Afghanistan, which stands as a **testament** to the strong relations between the two sides. Afghanistan cherishes its friendship with China, and appreciates the assistance offered by China at the most trying times, especially anti-epidemic support and **direly** needed humanitarian assistance. Afghanistan is ready to **capitalize** on its unique geographic advantage to participate more in the Belt and Road cooperation and serve as bridge in regional connectivity.

   **王毅国务委员兼外长表示，中方愿在尊重阿主权前提下，本着注重改善和提高民生、注重提升阿自主发展能力、注重实际效果、不开空头支票的原则，同阿有序开展互利合作，助力阿将资源优势转化为发展优势。中方赞赏并欢迎阿积极参与共建“一带一路”，愿推动中巴经济走廊向阿富汗延伸，复制更多成功经验，使地处“亚洲之心”的阿富汗成为地区互联互通的纽带桥梁。**

   State Councilor Wang said that on the premise of respecting Afghanistan’s sovereignty, China is ready to carry out mutually beneficial cooperation with Afghanistan in an orderly manner with a focus on improving people’s **livelihood** and enhancing Afghanistan’s capacity for self-reliant development, so as to help Afghanistan translate its rich resources into development opportunities. In this process, we will work for tangible results instead of **making empty promises**. China appreciates and welcomes Afghanistan’s active participation in the Belt and Road Initiative, and will work towards extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan, replicate more successful experiences, and make Afghanistan, with the geographical strength as the “Heart of Asia”, a bridge for regional connectivity.

3. **路透社记者：昨天，中国与所罗门群岛的一项安全合作协议草案在社交媒体发布，引发澳大利亚政府官员关切。该协议草案赋予中方使用其安全力量保护在所人员和重要项目安全的权利，并允许中方船只访问或经停所罗门群岛。外交部可否证实该草案的真伪？对草案内容有何评论？**

   Reuters: A draft of a security cooperation agreement between China and Solomon Islands has recently prompted some concern from members of the Australian government. The draft of the security cooperation agreement, which was shared on social media yesterday, proposes giving China the right to use its forces to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands. It will also allow Chinese ships to visit and make stopover at this archipelago. We want to ask the foreign ministry, firstly does it acknowledge that this draft is authentic, and secondly do you have any further comment on the contents of the draft?

   **汪文斌：我们已多次就中所警务和安全领域合作阐明立场。去年11月所罗门群岛暴发严重社会骚乱，民众生命和财产安全受到巨大威胁。中方坚定支持所罗门政府止暴制乱、维护稳定，向所方提供多批警用物资援助，并派出临时警务顾问组赴所罗门开展培训，帮助所警方加强自身能力建设，受到所罗门政府和社会各界广泛赞誉。中所作为两个主权独立国家，在平等相待、互利共赢基础上开展正常的执法和安全合作，这符合国际法和国际惯例，有利于维护所罗门社会秩序，有利于促进地区和平稳定，有利于增进两国以及地区各国的共同利益。**

   Wang Wenbin: We have made clear our position on China-Solomon Islands policing and security cooperation on many occasions. In November last year, serious unrest broke out in Solomon Islands, putting the lives and property of the people at great risk. China firmly supports the Solomon Islands government in ending the violence and chaos and maintaining stability. China has provided multiple batches of police equipment and sent an ad-hoc police advisory team to the country to conduct training and help its police strengthen capacity-building, which has been widely praised by the Solomon Islands government and all sectors of society. As two sovereign and independent states, China and Solomon Islands conduct normal law enforcement and security cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, which conforms to international law and customary practice. Such cooperation is conducive to maintaining stability in Solomon Islands, promoting regional peace and stability, and enhancing the common interests of China, Solomon Islands and other countries in the region.

4. **塔斯社记者：有报道称，最近乌克兰局势进一步恶化，这会影响中国从乌克兰进口粮食。中方为保障自身粮食安全是否在寻找新的办法？如果乌克兰无法出口小麦等谷物，中国是否会寻求建立新的产业链，比如从俄罗斯等国进口更多粮食？**

   TASS: The latest deterioration in the Russia-Ukraine situation will affect China’s import of grains from Ukraine. Is China looking at this issue and trying to find new ways to ensure its food security? If Ukraine is unable to export grains including wheat, will China form new supply chains and start buying more grains from other countries such as Russia?

   **汪文斌：关于你提到的具体问题，建议你向主管部门询问。我想告诉大家的是，乌克兰局势已经并将进一步对全球经贸、金融、能源、粮食、产业链供应链造成巨大冲击，严重影响各国民众正常生活，使本已困难的世界经济雪上加霜。世界经济复苏势头不应当受到破坏，各国人民也没有责任为地缘冲突和大国博弈埋单。**

   Wang Wenbin: Please turn to the competent authorities for an answer to this question. I would like to say that the situation in Ukraine has had and will continue to have an enormous impact on the global economy and trade, finance, energy, food and the industrial and supply chains, severely affecting the normal life of people in all countries and debilitating the already struggling world economy. The momentum of global economic recovery should not be dampened and people around the world should not be made to pay the price for geopolitical conflict and major power rivalry. 

   

   **中方将继续为推动乌克兰局势缓和发挥建设性作用，并愿与各方加强沟通合作，为世界经济稳定、健康、可持续发展注入更多正能量。**

   China will continue to play a constructive role in easing the situation in Ukraine and stands ready to strengthen communication and cooperation with all parties to provide more positive energy for the steady, sound and sustainable development of the world economy.

5. **法新社记者：第一个问题，朝鲜周四发射洲际弹道导弹后，美国对朝实施了新制裁。中方对此有何评论？第二个问题，据韩国媒体报道，习近平主席将同韩国当选总统尹锡悦通话。你能否证实？双方是否会讨论朝鲜最新射导问题？**

   AFP: The US has imposed fresh sanctions on North Korea after the country launched an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday. How does China react to this? And second question, ROK media reports say that President Xi Jinping is expected to have a phone call with the newly-elected ROK President Yoon Suk-yeol. Will the two leaders also discuss the latest North Korean missile launch? And could you also confirm whether such a call is actually going to take place?

   **汪文斌：关于第一个问题，我们注意到有关情况，对目前事态表示关切。中方一贯主张，对话协商是解决朝鲜半岛问题的唯一正确途径。当前形势下，任何可能导致局势进一步恶化升级的举动都是不可取的。**

   Wang Wenbin: On your first question, we have noted with concern the latest developments. It is our consistent view that dialogue and consultation is the only right path to resolving the Korean Peninsula issue. Under current circumstances, any step that might lead to further deterioration or escalation of the situation is ill-advised.

   

   **延续半岛对话缓和势头，维护半岛和平稳定，推进半岛问题政治解决进程，符合各方共同利益。我们希望有关各方保持冷静克制，坚持政治解决大方向，相互释放善意，尽快恢复对话，积极寻求打破僵局的方案。中方将继续为实现半岛无核化和推动政治解决半岛问题发挥建设性作用。**

   It is in all sides’ interest to sustain the momentum for dialogue and deescalation, safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and advance the political settlement process. It is hoped that all sides will remain calm, exercise self-restraint, stay committed to the course of political resolution, exchange good will, resume dialogue as soon as possible, and work actively to find a solution to break the deadlock. China will continue to play a constructive role in realizing the denuclearization of the Peninsula and advancing the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.

   

   **关于第二个问题，中韩互为重要近邻和重要合作伙伴。尹锡悦先生当选韩国总统后，习近平主席即致电表示祝贺，表达重视和发展中韩关系的积极立场。中韩双方都重视高层互动对两国友好合作关系的引领作用。关于你提到的通话事宜，我们会及时发布消息。**

   On your second question, China and the ROK are important close neighbors and cooperation partners. President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Mr. Yoon Suk-yeol upon his election as President of the ROK, and expressed the positive position of attaching importance to and hoping to develop China-ROK relations. Both sides place emphasis on the guiding role of high-level exchange in bilateral friendship and cooperation. With regard to the phone call you mentioned, we will release information in a timely manner.

6. **东方卫视记者：据报道，东盟缅甸问题特使、柬埔寨副首相兼外交大臣布拉索昆于3月21日至23日对缅甸进行工作访问，此访系东盟特使首次访缅。中方对这一进展有何评论？**

   Dragon TV: It is reported that ASEAN’s special envoy for Myanmar and Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn paid a working visit to Myanmar from March 21 to 23. This is the ASEAN’s special envoy’s first visit to Myanmar. Do you have any comment on this latest development?

   **汪文斌：东盟缅甸问题特使首次访缅是特使根据东盟“五点共识”开展斡旋工作的重要一步。缅甸是东盟大家庭成员。中方支持东盟以“东盟方式”妥善处理缅甸问题，支持东盟轮值主席国柬埔寨发挥积极作用，为缅各方通过政治对话妥处分歧、尽快恢复稳定与发展作出重要贡献。**

   Wang Wenbin: The first visit to Myanmar made by ASEAN’s special envoy for Myanmar is an important step in the special envoy’s mediation efforts following the five-point consensus of ASEAN. Myanmar is a member of the ASEAN family. China supports ASEAN in properly handling the Myanmar issue in the ASEAN way. We support Cambodia, the rotating ASEAN chair, in playing an active role and making important contributions to help all parties in Myanmar properly settle their disputes through political dialogue and resume stability and development at an early date.

7. **路透社记者：追问一个关于中国与所罗门群岛安全合作协议的问题。澳大利亚政府已就中所安全合作协议草案表达关切。澳防长达顿称，中方或将在所罗门群岛建立军事基地。外交部对此有何评论？**

   Reuters: I want to just follow up on the question about this security cooperation agreement between China and Solomon Islands. Specifically is the foreign ministry aware that the Australian government has already expressed concerns about this draft? Defense Minister Peter Dutton has already said that this is perhaps something that could become a Chinese military base on the islands. And so we just wanted to ask the foreign ministry whether it’s aware of the specific reports regarding this draft and whether you could comment on the veracity of these reports?

   **汪文斌：我刚才已经介绍了，中所两国在平等相待、互利共赢基础上开展正常的执法和安全合作，符合两国以及地区国家的共同利益。我们希望有关方面客观冷静看待，不要过度解读。澳大利亚个别政客发表所谓中国“胁迫”谬论，蓄意制造紧张氛围，既不负责任，也无助于地区稳定和发展。**

   Wang Wenbin: As I just said, China and Solomon Islands conduct normal law enforcement and security cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, which serves the interests of both countries and others in the region. We hope relevant sides will look at this in an objective and rational light and refrain from reading too much into it. It is irresponsible for a few Australian politicians to make absurd remarks about China “coercing” others. Such remarks intended to create an atmosphere of tension are not conducive to peace and development in the region.

8. **总台央视记者：今年3月24日是北约轰炸南联盟23周年，塞尔维亚总统武契奇在接受采访时表示，23年后的今天，可以非常清楚地看到19个北约成员国的行为多么可怕、荒谬、非法和不道德，现在他们指责俄罗斯“入侵”乌克兰是多么愚蠢可耻，他们经常挂在嘴边的道德和价值观根本不存在。中方对此有何评论？**

   CCTV: Speaking on the 23rd anniversary of the start of the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić said in an interview on March 24, “Now, after 23 years, one can see with clarity how despicable, ill-judged, unlawful and immoral this operation by 19 NATO countries was” and how “ridiculous, even stupid, to hear them now blaming Russia for its so-called aggression against Ukraine”, adding that “the morals, principles and values they constantly talk about do not exist at all”. Does China have any comment?

   **汪文斌：从1999年3月24日开始，以美国为首的北约军队严重违反有关国际公约和国际关系基本准则，公然绕过联合国安理会，悍然对主权国家南联盟进行78天持续轰炸，轰炸次数达1.2万次，投下1万多吨炸药，发射3000多枚导弹，从医疗设施、文化古迹到民宅学校无一幸免，造成包括3名中国记者在内数以千计的无辜平民丧生。在此次行动当中，北约还动用国际公约禁止的贫铀弹，对塞尔维亚的环境和人民健康造成长期恶劣影响。北约的侵略行径，塞尔维亚人民不会忘记，中国人民不会忘记，世界人民也不会忘记。**

   Wang Wenbin: On March 24 1999, US-led NATO forces blatantly bypassed the UN Security Council and began the 78-day incessant bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a sovereign country, in grave violation of relevant international conventions and basic norms governing international relations. In 12,000 strikes, over 10,000 tonnes of explosives were dropped and more than 3,000 missiles fired, targeting everything from medical facilities to ancient cultural relics, residential buildings and schools. Thousands of innocent civilians including three Chinese journalists were killed. During the bombing campaign, NATO even used depleted uranium bombs prohibited by international conventions, causing long-term damage to Serbia’s environment and people’s health. The people of Serbia will not forget NATO’s aggression, nor will the people of China and the rest of the world.

   

   **就在北约轰炸南联盟23周年之际，北约召开特别峰会，讨论乌克兰问题。美国和北约国家有没有反思过，乌克兰危机的根源何在？美国和北约应该为此承担什么样的责任？美国和北约在反省其对塞尔维亚、伊拉克、阿富汗等国人民犯下的罪行之前，没有权利和资格以审判官自居。作为冷战的产物，北约为战争而活，从来没有也不会给世界增加安全和安宁。真正热爱和平、致力于促进和平的人都会对北约的持续扩张大声说不！**

   NATO is convening a summit on Ukraine on the 23rd anniversary of its bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I wonder if the US and other NATO members have asked themselves: What is the root cause of the Ukraine crisis? What responsibility should the US and NATO assume? Before reflecting on their crimes against the people in countries like Serbia, Iraq and Afghanistan, the US and NATO have neither right nor authority to judge others. Born out of the Cold War, NATO serves no other purpose than war. It has never contributed to peace and security of our world and will never do so. All those who truly love peace and are committed to advancing peace will resolutely reject NATO’s continued expansion.

9. **总台央广记者：据报道，3月24日，埃塞俄比亚联邦政府发表声明，宣布在提格雷州实行人道主义休战。中方对此有何评论？**

   CNR: According to reports, the federal government of Ethiopia declared a humanitarian truce in the Tigray region in a statement on March 24. Do you have any comment?

   **汪文斌：日前，埃塞俄比亚政府宣布无限期人道主义休战，以保障人道主义援助物资能够正常进入提格雷州，改善当地的人道主义局势。中方对此表示欢迎。中方支持埃塞有关各方通过对话和谈判弥合分歧、平息冲突、实现和解，衷心希望埃塞享有和平稳定、实现发展繁荣。**

   Wang Wenbin: Recently Ethiopia’s government announced an “indefinite humanitarian truce” allowing humanitarian relief supplies into the Tigray region to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground. China welcomes this. China supports all parties in Ethiopia in bridging differences, quelling the conflict and realizing reconciliation through dialogue and negotiation, and sincerely hopes that Ethiopia will enjoy peace and stability and achieve development and prosperity. 

   

   **中方已向埃塞提供了粮食、疫苗等人道主义援助，协助缓解埃塞北部的人道主义困难。中国外交部非洲之角事务特使近期访问了埃塞等非洲之角地区国家。中方未来将继续向包括提格雷州在内的埃塞提供人道主义援助，为促进地区和平、稳定与发展贡献力量。**

    China has provided humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, including food and vaccines, to help ease the humanitarian difficulties in the northern part of the country. China’s special envoy for the Horn of Africa affairs of the Foreign Ministry lately visited countries in the region, including Ethiopia. Going forward, China will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, including the Tigray region, and contribute to promoting regional peace, stability and development.

10. **路透社记者：王毅国务委员兼外长正对印度进行访问。外交部可否介绍更多情况？**

    Reuters: Does the foreign ministry have any details to share about Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s potential visit to India?

    **汪文斌：关于王毅国务委员兼外长对印度进行工作访问的情况，我们会及时发布消息。请你保持关注。**

    Wang Wenbin: We will release information on State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s working visit to India in a timely manner. Please stay tuned.

11. **澎湃新闻记者：24日，北约峰会发表联合声明，呼吁包括中国在内的所有国家维护国际秩序，包括《联合国宪章》中的维护主权和领土完整原则，避免对俄战争行为予以任何支持或帮助俄规避制裁。中方对此有何评论？**

    The Paper: NATO Heads of State and Government issued a joint statement after their meeting on March 24, calling on all states, including China, to uphold the international order including the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity as enshrined in the UN Charter, to abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions. Do you have any comment on that?

    **汪文斌：中方在乌克兰问题上始终从事情本身的是非曲直出发，为缓和局势、化解危机、重建和平而努力。**

    Wang Wenbin: China proceeds from the merits of the matter itself on the Ukraine issue and makes effort to deescalate the situation, resolve the crisis and rebuild peace. 

    

    **我们一贯主张，和平是最珍贵的。当务之急，是停火止战，而对话谈判是最现实可行的方式。国际社会应当鼓励俄乌双方谈下去而不是打下去。冲突延续升级只会造成更大伤亡，不符合任何一方利益。不断升级制裁只会使少数人获益，遭殃的是广大老百姓。**

    We always maintain that nothing is more precious than peace. The pressing priority at this moment is to cease hostilities, and dialogue and negotiation is the most realistic and viable way to do so. The international community should encourage Russia and Ukraine to keep up the talks rather than the fighting. The continuation and escalation of the conflict will only cause greater casualties and serve no one’s interest. Escalating sanctions will benefit only a few while making the people suffer. 

    

    **我们一贯主张，安全是不可分割的。搞集团对抗、谋求绝对安全恰恰会导致最不安全的后果。乌克兰应当成为东西方沟通的桥梁，而不应当成为大国博弈的前沿。欧洲各国应当努力构建均衡、有效、可持续的地区安全架构，而不是重划东西对抗的分界线。美国和北约应当同俄罗斯开展对话，而不是再打一场新冷战。**

    We always believe that security is indivisible. Seeking bloc confrontation and absolute security will only lead to the most insecure scenario. Ukraine should be a bridge for communication between the East and the West, rather than the frontline for major power rivalry. Countries in Europe should work to build a balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture, rather than redraw the line of confrontation between the East and the West. The US and NATO should hold dialogue with Russia, rather than start a new Cold War. 

    

    **我们一贯主张，处理国际关系不应有双重标准。乌克兰的主权、安全应当得到维护，俄罗斯的合理安全关切同样应当得到尊重。欧洲的和平、稳定值得捍卫，其他国家的和平、稳定同样值得守护。不能一边声称反对战争，一边又四处发动战争；一边声称维护和平，一边又肆意破坏和平。**

    We always hold that there should be no double standard in international relations. Ukraine’s sovereignty and security should be upheld, and Russia’s legitimate security concerns should also be respected. Europe’s peace and stability should be defended. The same goes for other countries. One shall not wage wars across the world while saying it’s against war, or wantonly shatter peace while claiming to uphold peace. 

    

    **中方在乌克兰问题上发挥的是建设性作用，我们主持的是公道，谋求的是和平，着眼的是长远。我们支持对话谈判，积极向乌克兰和其他受影响的国家提供人道主义援助，愿同国际社会一道，推动乌克兰危机尽快得到政治解决。我们呼吁相关各方保持冷静克制，展现政治意愿，让理智战胜情绪，让远见战胜短视，让共同利益战胜个别私利，早日停火止战，避免平民伤亡，防止更大规模人道危机，共同致力于欧洲和世界的长治久安。**

    China plays a constructive role on the Ukraine issue. We speak for justice and work for peace with a long-term vision. We support dialogue and negotiation, actively provide humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other affected countries, and stand ready to work with the international community to promote the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis as soon as possible. We call on relevant parties to remain cool-headed and restrained, show political will, and make sure their rationality prevails over emotions, vision triumphs over short-sightedness, and common interests rise above selfish gains. We call for efforts to achieve a ceasefire at an early date, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a larger-scale humanitarian crisis and to realize the long-term peace and stability in Europe and beyond.

    

    **中方的立场同大多数国家的愿望相一致。我们反对针对中方的无端指责和猜忌，更不接受任何施压与胁迫。时间将证明，中方的主张是站在历史正确的一边。**

    China’s position is in line with the wishes of most countries. We stand against groundless accusations and suspicions targeting China, and never accept any pressure and coercion. Time will prove that China’s position is on the right side of history.

12. **法新社记者：第三次阿富汗邻国外长会将于3月30日还是31日开始？除俄罗斯、巴基斯坦确认参会外，还有哪些国家可能出席？**

    AFP: Could you confirm the exact dates for this conference of Afghanistan’s neighbors? Is it starting on March 30 or 31? And in addition to the confirmed attendance by Russia and Pakistan, who else might be attending?

    **汪文斌：关于你提到的这些问题，我们会适时发布消息。**

    Wang Wenbin: We will release information in due course, where you will find answers to these questions.

1. 新华社记者：当前形势下，中方对第三次阿富汗邻国外长会有何期待？

   Xinhua News Agency:What is China’s expectation of the third Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan under the current circumstances?

   汪文斌：当前，阿富汗局势处于由乱及治的关键时期，阿富汗人民仍面临内外多重挑战，需要外界更多支持和帮助。中方期待通过主办第三次阿富汗邻国外长会，进一步凝聚邻国在阿富汗问题上的共识，商讨下阶段共同推动阿富汗局势向稳、支持帮助阿富汗人民的“邻国方案”，向国际社会传递“邻国声音”。我们期待通过主办“阿富汗邻国+阿富汗”外长对话，进一步了解阿富汗人民的困难和诉求，传达邻国在阿富汗问题上的关切，推动阿富汗方面搭建开放包容的政治架构，奉行温和稳健的内外政策，切实打击恐怖主义。同时，我们也期待国际社会向阿富汗提供更大支持，呼吁美国切实承担对阿富汗经济重建的首要责任。

   Wang Wenbin: The Afghan situation is now in a critical transition from chaos to order, with the Afghan people still facing multiple challenges from within and outside that need to be addressed with more support and help from others. By hosting the third Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, China looks forward to pooling more consensus on the Afghan issue from neighboring countries, discussing ways to jointly stabilize the Afghan situation and support and help the Afghan people, and share our voice with the rest of the international community as neighbors of Afghanistan. By hosting the “Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan Plus Afghanistan” Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue, we hope to further understand the Afghan people’s difficulties and needs, convey neighboring countries’ concerns on the Afghan issue, and work on the Afghan side to build an open and inclusive political structure, follow moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies and earnestly combat terrorism. In the meantime, we also expect the international community to give greater support to Afghanistan and call on the US to shoulder the primary responsibility for Afghanistan’s economic reconstruction in real earnest.

2. 澎湃新闻记者：请介绍一下中方邀请四个东盟国家外长访华的有关考虑。中方对访问有何期待？
   The Paper: What is China’s consideration behind its inviting of the four ASEAN countries’ foreign ministers for a visit? Does China have any expectation for this visit?
   汪文斌：印尼、泰国、菲律宾、缅甸四国均是东盟重要成员，是中国的友好邻邦和高质量共建“一带一路”的重要伙伴。新冠肺炎疫情发生以来，中方一直以灵活方式同东盟各国保持经常往来和沟通，持续深化抗疫和复苏合作，共克时艰、共谋发展。四国外长来访再次体现了中方同东盟邻国间的亲密友好关系，以及各方对推进中国东盟合作的高度重视。
   Wang Wenbin: Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Myanmar are important ASEAN members and China’s friendly neighbors and important partners for high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. Since COVID-19 broke out, China has maintained regular exchanges and communication with ASEAN countries in a flexible manner, continuously deepened cooperation on COVID-19 and economic recovery, stood together to overcome difficulties and seek common development. The upcoming visit of the four foreign ministers again demonstrates the close and friendly relations between China and its ASEAN neighbors and the high importance all sides attach to advancing China-ASEAN cooperation.

   今年是中国东盟全面战略伙伴关系的起步之年。中方期待通过此访，与各方共同落实好去年中国东盟建立对话关系30周年纪念峰会成果共识，推动全球发展倡议在周边率先落地，携手打造和平、安宁、繁荣、美丽、友好的共同家园。中方还将同各方就当前地区和国际形势深入交换意见，为地区和平稳定和世界繁荣发展注入更多正能量。
   This year marks the starting year of the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. Through this visit, China hopes to work with all parties to ensure the sound implementation of the outcomes and consensus of the ASEAN-China Special Summit to Commemorate the 30th Anniversary of ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations last year, promote the materialization of the Global Development Initiative in neighboring countries first, and jointly build a peaceful, tranquil, prosperous, beautiful and friendly homeland. China will also have in-depth exchanges of views with all parties on the current regional and international situation and contribute more positive energy to regional peace and stability and global prosperity and development.

3. 路透社记者：美国总统拜登上周日澄清美国不寻求俄罗斯政权更迭的政策。此前，拜登宣称普京不能继续掌权。外交部对此有何评论？

   Reuters: On Sunday, US President Joe Biden clarified that the United States does not have a policy of regime change in Russia after its declaration that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?

   汪文斌：我们注意到有关报道。我要强调的是，对话谈判是解决乌克兰问题的唯一正确途径。当前各方亟需做的是缓和局势，促谈止战，而不是激化矛盾。在事关欧洲和世界和平与稳定的重大问题上，各方应该采取负责任的言行，发挥建设性作用。

   Wang Wenbin: We noted relevant reports. I want to stress that dialogue and negotiation is the only right path to resolving the Ukraine issue. It’s a pressing task for all parties to ease the situation, promote peace talks and stop the fighting, rather than escalate tensions. On major issues concerning peace and stability in Europe and the world at large, all parties should speak and act responsibly and play a constructive role.

4. 总台央视记者：今天上午，第20架接返自乌克兰撤离中国公民临时航班从罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特安全抵达福州。发言人能否进一步介绍有关情况？

   CCTV: An ad hoc flight carrying Chinese citizens evacuated from Ukraine landed safely in Fuzhou this morning. This one from Bucharest, Romania’s capital, is the 20th flight that has taken Chinese citizens home from Ukraine. Can you share more information?

   汪文斌：乌克兰局势恶化以来，党中央、国务院高度牵挂每一位在乌中国公民的安危。习近平总书记亲自关心，多次过问，要求全力确保中国公民的安全。王毅国务委员兼外长在与乌克兰外长库列巴通话时强调，希望乌方采取一切必要措施保护在乌中国公民安全，并为中国公民撤离提供保障和便利。外交部和驻乌克兰使馆、驻敖德萨总领馆第一时间启动领事保护应急机制，将“外交为民”理念落到实处，与在乌的中国同胞建立联系、想尽办法协调调动资源，保护在乌中国公民的安全，并协助他们以各种方式有序安全撤离。中国驻摩尔多瓦、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、斯洛伐克、波兰、白俄罗斯等乌克兰周边国家的使馆与驻乌克兰使领馆密切衔接，为中国公民入境通关、临时安置和有关临时航班的运行提供协助。

   Wang Wenbin: The CPC Central Committee and the State Council deeply care about the safety of every Chinese citizen in Ukraine ever since the situation there deteriorated. General Secretary Xi Jinping gave personal attention to and repeatedly inquired about the issue, demanding that the safety of our citizens must be ensured with all-out efforts. In his phone conversation with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed the hope that the Ukrainian side will take all necessary measures to protect Chinese citizens’ safety and provide guarantee and convenience for their evacuation. Committed to serving the people with real actions, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the Chinese Embassy in Ukraine and the Chinese Consulate General in Odessa immediately activated the emergency mechanism for consular protection, contacted Chinese compatriots in Ukraine and went to great lengths to mobilize resources with a view to protecting the safety of Chinese citizens and helping them evacuate in an orderly and safe manner in various ways. The Chinese embassies in Ukraine’s neighboring countries including Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Belarus worked closely with the embassy and consulate in Ukraine to facilitate the customs clearance and temporary settlement of Chinese citizens and the operation of relevant ad hoc flights.


   在整个撤离工作过程中，共有5200多名在乌中国公民安全撤离至乌周边国家。除1人在自驾途中受伤并已治疗无虞之外，其余自愿撤离的同胞全部平安，做到了战乱撤离“无死亡，无群伤”。4600多名撤离至乌周边国家的中国公民搭乘20架次中国政府安排的临时航班回到祖国。全体在乌和乌周边国家中国同胞互相帮助、共渡难关，留学生组织、华侨华人社团多次协助完成撤离工作，发扬了中华民族扶危济困的优良传统，展现出中华儿女团结互助的优良品质。

   Over 5,200 Chinese citizens have been safely evacuated to Ukraine’s neighboring countries. Except for one individual who got injured while trying to drive away from the country and has now been cured, all Chinese compatriots who wanted to leave are safe and sound. During this evacuation process amid the fighting, not a single Chinese citizen was killed and no mass injury incidents happened. The Chinese government has sent a total of 20 ad hoc flights to bring back more than 4,600 Chinese citizens who had earlier been relocated to Ukraine’s neighboring countries. In the meantime, all Chinese compatriots in Ukraine and neighboring countries have stood together to overcome the difficulties with mutual support. Organizations of Chinese students and associations of overseas Chinese in Ukraine have pitched in to help with the evacuations. They have carried forward the Chinese nation’s best tradition of helping those in distress and aiding those in peril and demonstrated the Chinese people’s fine character of solidarity and mutual assistance. 


   在组织中国公民避难和撤离过程当中，乌克兰政府和社会各界给予了友好协助，俄罗斯、摩尔多瓦、罗马尼亚、波兰、匈牙利、斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯等国也提供了宝贵支持。我们向各国政府和人民表示衷心感谢。

   As we worked on the safety and evacuation of Chinese nationals, the government and various sectors of society in Ukraine showed goodwill and provided facilitation. Countries including Russia, Moldova, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Belarus also provided invaluable support. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to governments and peoples of those countries. 


   现在，撤离在乌克兰中国公民的工作已告一段落，但保护海外同胞生命安全与正当权益的征程“永远在路上”。下一步，外交部和中国驻外使领馆将继续积极推进领事保护机制建设，持续打造“海外平安中国”，以实际行动告诉每一位海外同胞，无论什么时刻，无论身处何方，你的身边有我们，你的背后是祖国。

   Now, the evacuation work has basically come to an end, but protecting the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals overseas is always an abiding commitment. Looking forward, the Foreign Ministry and Chinese diplomatic missions abroad will continue to actively improve the consular protection mechanism and build a system for the protection of Chinese nationals and interests overseas. With everything we do, we will show every one of our compatriots overseas that we stand with you at all times, wherever you may be, and your motherland will always have your back.

5. 法新社记者：菲律宾海岸警卫队称，一艘中国海警船于3月2日在南海行驶至距一艘菲律宾巡逻船仅数米的地方。另外，菲律宾将与美国举行军事演习。中方对此有何回应？
   AFP: The Philippine Coast Guard said that a China Coast Guard ship steered meters from one of its patrol vessels on March 2 in the South China Sea. And the Philippines and the US are set to stage war games. What’s your response to this?
   汪文斌：黄岩岛是中国固有领土。中国对黄岩岛及其附近海域拥有主权，对相关海域拥有主权权利和管辖权。希望菲方船只切实尊重中方主权和权益，遵守中国的国内法和国际法，避免干扰影响中国海警在上述海域的巡航执法。
   Wang Wenbin: Huangyan Dao is China’s inherent territory. China has sovereignty over Huangyan Dao and its adjacent waters as well as sovereign rights and jurisdiction over relevant waters. We hope that the Philippine ships will earnestly respect China’s sovereignty and rights and interests, abide by China’s domestic law and international law, and avoid interfering with the patrol and law enforcement of the China Coast Guard in the above-mentioned waters.

6. 共同社记者：我想问有关阿富汗外长会的事情，王毅国务委员有无计划与俄罗斯外长举行双边会晤，是否会谈到乌克兰问题？
   Kyodo News: With regard to the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, does State Councilor Wang Yi have any plan to hold a bilateral meeting with the Russian foreign minister? Will they talk about the Ukraine issue?
   汪文斌：我刚才已经发布了相关消息，没有消息需要补充。
   Wang Wenbin: I announced the relevant information just now and have nothing more to add.

7. 总台央广记者：据报道，25日，国际原子能机构（IAEA）举行线上新闻发布会称，机构技术工作组21日至25日到访日本并与日本原子能规制委员会举行会谈，审查其关于福岛核污染水排海计划的监管活动是否符合机构的安全标准。本次考察的评估报告预计将于两个月后发布。中方对此有何评论？

   CNR: According to reports, the IAEA said at an online news conference on March 25 that its technical working group visited Japan from March 21 to 25 and had meetings with Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority to review whether the monitoring activities over the discharge plan of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water conform to IAEA’s safety standards. The assessment report of this visit is expected to be released in two months. What is China’s comment?

   汪文斌：中方一直关注日本福岛核污染水处置问题动向。全面、科学、严谨的监管方案有助于福岛核污染水的安全处置，日方应就此向机构技术工作组提供密切配合。我们也希望机构及时向国际社会、尤其是利益攸关方通报考察评估情况。

   Wang Wenbin: China has been following the developments of the disposal of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water. A comprehensive, science-based and rigorous monitoring plan is conducive to the safe disposal of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water. In this regard, the Japanese side should closely cooperate with the IAEA working group. It is hoped that the IAEA can inform the international community, especially stakeholders, of the assessment on a timely basis.


   核污染水处置计划的监管固然重要，但选择正确的核污染水处置方案才是问题的根本。我们希望有关监管安排的讨论，能促使日方积极回应各方关切，在充分评估各种核污染水处置方案利弊前提下再做决策，而不是固守排海方案。我也想再次强调，中方支持技术工作组的工作，不代表我们认同日方向海洋排放核污染水的决策。

   It is true that monitoring the disposal plan of the nuclear-contaminated water is important, but the crux of the issue is choosing the right plan to dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water. We hope the discussion of relevant monitoring arrangement can make Japan actively respond to the concerns of all parties and make the decision after fully assessing the advantages and disadvantages of all disposal plans, instead of sticking to the ocean discharge plan. I also want to stress again that China’s support for the work of the technical working group does not mean we endorse Japan’s decision to release the nuclear-contaminated water into the sea.

8. 澳亚卫视记者：针对中国同所罗门群岛签署有关安全合作协议，美国、澳大利亚官员表示担忧，认为中国没必要输出其警务力量，声称这可能动摇太平洋地区现行安全合作机制，对岛国没有好处。请问中方对此有何评论？
   MASTV: In response to the security cooperation agreement signed by China and Solomon Islands, some officials of the US and Australia have expressed their concerns, saying they don’t believe China’s police forces need to be exported and claiming that it may undermine the current security cooperation mechanism in the Pacific region and may do no good to the island nations. What is China’s comment on this?
   汪文斌：上周我已经介绍了中方的相关立场。中国和所罗门群岛是两个主权独立国家，两国开展正常的执法安全合作，符合国际法和国际惯例，有利于所社会稳定和长治久安，有利于增进地区国家共同利益，无可指摘。我也注意到，所罗门群岛政府发表了一份声明，全面阐述了所国家安全战略和对外合作情况，感谢所有发展伙伴的支持和帮助，强调所方有扩大多元化合作的实际需要。有关国家应切实尊重所方的主权，尊重所方自主做出的决定，而不是以居高临下姿态认为自己有资格、有特权界定其他国家应该做什么，不应该做什么。
   Wang Wenbin: I stated China’s position on this issue last week. Normal law enforcement and security cooperation between China and Solomon Islands, two sovereign and independent countries, is consistent with international law and customary international practice. It is beyond reproach as it is beneficial to social stability and lasting security of Solomon Islands and the common interest of regional countries. I also noted that the government of Solomon Islands issued a statement which elaborated on the country’s security strategy and cooperation with other countries, expressed gratitude to the support and assistance of all development partners, and emphasized the country’s need for expanding diverse cooperation. Relevant countries should earnestly respect Solomon Islands’ sovereignty and its independent decisions instead of deciding what others should and should not do self-importantly and condescendingly from a privileged position.

   中所合作受到所政府和人民真诚欢迎，为什么有人会感到担忧？是谁常年派遣军机军舰到别人家门口耀武扬威，严重威胁有关国家主权安全？是谁在构建军事化的小圈子，将核扩散风险带到太平洋？又是谁蓄意渲染紧张氛围，制造阵营对立，给地区和平稳定蒙上阴影？国际社会对此自有公论，所罗门群岛和太平洋岛国人民也看得十分清楚。任何干扰破坏中国和太平洋岛国互利合作的图谋都不会得逞。
   Why are some individuals concerned about China-Solomon Islands cooperation when the government and the people of Solomon Islands genuinely welcome it? Who has been sending military aircraft and vessels right to others’ doorsteps and flex muscles for years that severely threaten relevant countries’ sovereignty and security? Who has been forming military circles that bring nuclear proliferation risks to the Pacific Ocean? And who has been deliberately hyping up tension and stoking bloc confrontation that cast a pall on regional peace and stability? The international community can make a fair judgement, and the people of Solomon Islands and other Pacific island countries can see this clearly. Any attempt to disrupt and undermine mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Pacific island countries is doomed to fail.

9. 彭博社记者：第一个问题，澳大利亚外交部上周末称，已接到中国政府通知，成蕾将于3月31日受审。外交部能否提供更多信息？第二个问题，据彭博社报道，知情人士称，中国驻华盛顿外交官一直在与美国外交官接触，询问美国对俄罗斯制裁细节。这让美国官员备受鼓舞，但他们仍然担心中国可能从中寻找漏洞以帮助俄罗斯。外交部对此有何评论？
   Bloomberg: Over the weekend, the Australian foreign ministry said that it had been notified by Chinese authorities that Cheng Lei will face trial on March 31. Does the foreign ministry have any more information on this trial? The second question, Bloomberg has reported that Chinese diplomats in Washington have been in contact with US counterparts asking for details on US sanctions on Russia. This has encouraged the US officials according to people familiar with the situation, though they remain wary that China may be looking for loopholes to help Russia according to the people. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?
   汪文斌：关于第一个问题，我们已多次就有关澳大利亚公民个案阐明立场。中国司法机关依法办案，并充分保障有关人员各项合法权利。关于你提到的具体情况，目前我没有可以向你提供的信息。
   Wang Wenbin: On your first question, we have repeatedly stated our position on the individual case involving the Australian citizen. China’s judiciary handles cases in accordance with law and fully protects the lawful rights of the person involved. As for the specifics you mentioned, I have nothing to offer you at present.

   关于第二个问题，中方始终认为，制裁不是解决问题的根本有效办法。中方坚决反对缺乏国际法依据、没有安理会授权的单边制裁和长臂管辖，这是中方在公开和内部场合一贯秉持的立场。历史经验一再表明，制裁解决不了问题，还会制造出新的问题。实施全方位、无差别制裁，受罪的是老百姓。如果进一步升级，还会引发全球经贸、金融、能源、粮食、产业链供应链等发生严重危机，使本已困难的世界经济雪上加霜，造成不可挽回的损失。
   Now coming to your second question, China always holds that sanctions are not fundamentally effective ways to solve problems. China stands firmly against unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction with no basis in international law and no mandate of the UN Security Council. This is China’s consistent position in both open and closed-door meetings. History has proven once and again that instead of solving problems, sanctions create new problems. It is the ordinary people that suffer from comprehensive and indiscriminate sanctions. If ratcheted up, sanctions can also trigger serious crisis on a global scale in such fields as economy, trade, finance, energy, food, industrial and supply chains. This will make the already struggling world economy even worse and cause irreparable losses. 

   联合国190多个成员国当中，有140多个国家未参与对俄制裁。这表明，世界上绝大多数国家都是以审慎和负责任的态度对待制裁问题的。正如王毅国务委员兼外长指出的，包括中国和发展中国家在内的大多数国家都认为，处理国际地区热点问题，并不是只有战争和制裁两种选择。各国人民并没有责任为地缘冲突和大国博弈埋单。形势越复杂，越需要冷静斟酌采取的行动会带来何种后果。希望各方都冷静下来，把精力集中于劝和促谈，而不是升级制裁、激化矛盾。
   Among the 190-plus UN member states, more than 140 did not take part in sanctions on Russia. This fact shows that the overwhelming majority of countries are handling issues related to sanctions in a prudent and responsible manner. As pointed out by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, most countries, including China and many fellow developing countries, share the view that war and sanction are not the only two choices when handling international and regional hotspot issues. It is not incumbent on the people to pay the price for geographic conflicts and major-power rivalry. The more complex the situation is, the greater the need to remain cool-headed and deliberate the consequences of actions. It is hoped that all sides can calm down to focus on promoting peace talks, rather than escalate sanctions and aggravate disputes. 

   我也注意到，有美国媒体把美国称作是全球唯一的“制裁超级大国”。据美国财政部发布的《2021年制裁评估报告》，截至2021财年，美国已生效的制裁措施累计达到9400多项，比20年前增长了近10倍。然而，尽管美国频频挥舞“制裁大棒”，却解决不了问题，反而加剧灾难动荡。有预测认为，美国从阿富汗撤军后，对阿实施的经济制裁将导致的平民死亡人数可能超过20年阿富汗战争的总和。
   I have also taken note of some US media calling the US the only “sanctions superpower” in the world. According to the 2021 Sanctions Review published by the US Treasury, by fiscal year 2021, the US has over 9,400 effective sanction designations, which is almost 10 times the number 20 years ago. However, although the US imposes sanctions repeatedly, such moves did not help to solve problems, but only aggravate disasters and chaos. It is estimated that following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the economic sanctions on the country could take the lives of more civilians than 20 years of war in Afghanistan. 

   我想强调的是，现在的问题不是谁要帮助俄罗斯绕过制裁，而是包括中国在内各国同俄的正常经贸往来已受到不必要的损害。我们敦促美方在处理乌克兰问题和对俄关系时，严肃认真对待中方关切，不得以任何方式损害中方正当权益。中方将采取一切必要措施，坚决维护中国企业和个人的正当合法权益。
   I would like to stress that the problem now is not about who wants to help Russia circumvent the sanctions, but about the fact that the normal trade and economic exchanges between countries, China included, and Russia have already been unnecessarily hurt. We urge the US to take China’s concerns seriously when handling the Ukraine issue and its relations with Russia and avoid undermining China’s legitimate rights and interests in any way. China will take all necessary measures to firmly uphold the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies and individuals.

10. 深圳卫视记者提问：据报道，27日，巴勒斯坦总统阿巴斯会见美国国务卿布林肯时强调，拜登政府要履行对巴勒斯坦的承诺，包括美国对巴以问题“两国方案”的承诺等。美国对待欧洲当前局势呈现出明显的双重标准，国际社会不应对巴勒斯坦的遭遇保持沉默。中方对此有何评论？
    Shenzhen TV: When meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on March 27, Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas stressed that the Biden administration needs to fulfill its commitment to Palestine, including its commitment to a two-state solution on the Palestine-Israel issue. On the current events in Europe, the US has shown blatant double standards, and the international community should not be silent about what’s happening in Palestine. Do you have any comment?
    汪文斌：巴勒斯坦问题不应被边缘化，更不应被遗忘。延宕半个多世纪的历史不公不应再持续下去。习近平主席提出了解决巴勒斯坦问题的四点主张。以此为指引，王毅国务委员兼外长提出了落实两国方案的三条具体思路。中方将继续坚定地同巴勒斯坦人民站在一起。
    Wang Wenbin: The Palestinian question should not be marginalized or forgotten, and the injustice lasting for over 50 years should not continue. Guided by the four-point proposal on the Palestinian question put forward by President Xi Jinping, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came up with three specific approaches for implementing the two-state solution. China will continue to stand firmly with the Palestinian people.

    我想强调的是，不管是巴勒斯坦问题，还是其他的国际和地区热点问题，国际社会都不应采取双重标准。
    I want to stress that the international community should not adopt double standard on the Palestinian question and other international and regional hotspot issues.

    乌克兰难民值得同情，而来自中东、非洲、拉美等国家的难民就不值得同情。这样的双重标准不可接受。
    It is unacceptable double standard to sympathize with refugees in Ukraine while turning a blind eye to refugees from countries in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.

    对乌克兰平民的伤害是战争罪行，对南联盟、阿富汗、伊拉克、叙利亚平民的伤害就可以不被追究。这样的双重标准不可接受。
    It is unacceptable double standard to call acts harming civilians in Ukraine war crimes, while allowing harm done to civilians in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria to go unpunished. 

    对乌克兰的攻击是对尊重主权原则的破坏，对南联盟、阿富汗、伊拉克、叙利亚的攻击就合理合法。这样的双重标准不可接受。
    It is unacceptable double standard to say the attacks on Ukraine undermine the principle of respect for sovereignty, while claiming the attacks on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria are legitimate and lawful.

    在乌克兰问题上强调主权不可侵犯，在南联盟、伊拉克等问题上高呼人权高于主权。这样的双重标准同样不可接受。
    It is unacceptable double standard to stress that sovereignty is inviolable on the Ukraine issue while claiming that human rights precede sovereignty when it comes to issues related to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Iraq.

    各国主权、领土完整都应得到尊重，联合国宪章宗旨和原则都应得到遵守，各国合理安全关切都应得到重视。只有摒弃双重标准，地区热点问题才能得到公正解决，欧洲和世界的持久和平才有望实现。
    The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed. The legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously. Only when double standard is discarded can regional hotspot issues be addressed in a just manner and the enduring peace achieved in Europe and other places of the world.

11. 路透社记者：澳大利亚外长上周六称，希望中方按照中澳领事协议允许澳大利亚官员旁听被捕的澳大利亚记者成蕾的庭审。外交部能否确认中方是否会同意？
    Reuters: Australia’s foreign minister on Saturday said that she hoped that Australian officials would be allowed to attend the hearing of arrested Australian journalist Cheng Lei in line with a consular agreement between the two nations. Can the foreign ministry confirm that this will be the case?
    汪文斌：我刚才已经回答了相关问题。
    Wang Wenbin: I have answered a relevant question already.

12. 法新社记者：俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫是否会出席将于本周召开的阿富汗邻国外长会？
    AFP: On the Afghan neighboring countries’ meeting this week, can you confirm whether Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will be attending?
    汪文斌：刚才我已经发布了相关消息。巴基斯坦、伊朗、俄罗斯、塔吉克斯坦、土库曼斯坦、乌兹别克斯坦六国外长或代表将出席3月30日至31日在安徽屯溪召开的第三次阿富汗邻国外长会。拉夫罗夫外长将应邀出席。
    Wang Wenbin: I have released the relevant information just now. Foreign Ministers or representatives of Pakistan, Iran, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan will attend the third Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan in Tunxi, Anhui on March 30 and 31. Foreign Minister Lavrov will attend the meeting upon invitation.

13. 《环球时报》记者：据报道，美军印太司令部司令阿奎利诺接受采访时称，乌克兰问题凸显中国对台湾构成的严重威胁。美国在亚洲的盟友必须严肃看待这一可能性。发言人对此有何评论？
    Global Times: US Indo-Pacific Command Admiral John C. Aquilino reportedly said in an interview that the Ukraine issue has underscored the serious threat that China poses to Taiwan, and that Asian allies must take seriously the possibility. What is your comment on this?
    汪文斌：我们已多次阐明，台湾问题与乌克兰问题有着本质区别，两者不可类比。美方一些人一再将两件不相干的事情扯在一起，借机对中方抹黑攻击。这纯属别有用心。
    Wang Wenbin: We have stated on multiple occasions that the Taiwan question is essentially different from the Ukraine issue. The two are uncomparable. Some people in the US repeatedly link up the two unrelated things with the real agenda to smear and attack China. Such an act is ill-intentioned. 

    冰冻三尺非一日之寒。乌克兰问题走到今天，是多年来积累矛盾的爆发，根子在于欧洲的安全问题。北约无限制东扩的做法值得反思。面对今天乌克兰的局势，美方不但不反思和检讨自己应该承担的责任，为缓和局势、劝和促谈作出努力，还不断拱火浇油。当欧洲国家为战争造成的难民和经济动荡付出代价时，美国的大军火商和油气公司却赚得盆满钵满。
    As a Chinese proverb puts it, it takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep. The current Ukraine issue is an outbreak of tension that has built up for years with Europe’s security as the root cause. NATO’s unchecked eastward expansion warrants reflection. Facing the current situation in Ukraine, the US did nothing to reflect on the responsibility it should assume, or make efforts to cool down the situation and promote talks for peace. Instead, it has been adding fuel to the flame. When European countries are paying the price for refugees and economic volatility due to the conflict, US arms dealers and oil and gas industry have made a fortune. 

    台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这同乌克兰是一个主权国家有着根本的不同。美方一些人故意拿台湾问题同乌克兰问题相类比，不是不通常识，而是用心险恶。其目的就是试图在台海制造一场新的危机，以两岸人民福祉和地区和平稳定为代价服务美国自身的地缘战略和经济利益。
    Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory. This makes it fundamentally different from a sovereign country like Ukraine. Those in the US who deliberately compare the Taiwan question with the Ukraine issue harbor a vile intention rather than lack common sense. Their real agenda is to create a new crisis across the Taiwan Strait to serve US geopolitical and economic interests at the expense of the wellbeing of people across the Strait and regional peace and stability.

    台湾不是乌克兰。中国人民捍卫国家主权和领土完整的决心和意志坚不可摧。在台湾问题上拱火，只会迎来玩火者自焚的结局。
    But Taiwan is not Ukraine. The Chinese people’s resolve and determination to uphold national sovereignty and territorial integrity is invincible. Those who play with and fan up the fire on the Taiwan question will only wind up burning themselves.

14. 路透社记者：关于东航MU5735航班坠毁事故调查的问题。周三，美国运输部长皮特·布蒂吉格称，中方邀请美国家运输安全委员会参与坠机事故调查令人鼓舞。但美国家运输安全委员会负责人称，由于签证和隔离要求的原因，尚未决定美方人员能否来华。外交部能否提供关于美方人员的签证和来华的最新情况？
    Reuters: Regarding the investigation of the MU5735 plane that tragically crashed, US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Wednesday that he was very encouraged by the fact that Chinese authorities had invited the US National Transportation Safety Board to take part in the investigation of the crash. However, the National Transportation Safety Board later said that it had not yet determined if the American investigators would travel to China due to visa and quarantine requirements. Does the foreign ministry have any updates on the visa situation and the visit of these US investigators?
    汪文斌：关于你提到的具体问题，建议你向有关部门了解。我可以告诉你的是，对于经中方批准来华协助有关事故调查的外方人员，中方将为其提供必要便利。
    Wang Wenbin: I would like to refer you to competent authorities for the specifics you asked. What I can tell you is that China will provide necessary facilitation to foreign personnel who are approved by the Chinese side to travel to China to assist in the investigation.

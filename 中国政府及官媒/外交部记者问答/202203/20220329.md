1. 总台央视记者：近日，欧洲政策中心、英国皇家国际事务研究所、卡内基欧洲中心等智库发表文章，对乌克兰危机进行反思。发言人对此有何评论？

   CCTV: Think tanks including the European Policy Center, the Royal Institute of International Affairs and Carnegie Europe recently published articles that shared their reflection on the Ukraine crisis. What is your comment?

   > - 中文：A，B，C等智库
   > - 英文：think tanks including a, b, and c

   汪文斌：我注意到，随着乌克兰危机的影响日益漫延外溢，欧洲战略界出现一些理性思考的声音。

   Wang Wenbin: I have noted the voices for reason and reflection in Europe’s **strategic community** as the Ukraine crisis continues to **generate spillover effects**. 


   比如，有的指出，制裁不是结束战争、构建欧洲安全秩序的出路。要想战争以和解方式结束，诉诸外交手段才是正道。面对俄罗斯这个搬不走的邻居，管理与俄关系是欧盟当前必须应对的首要挑战。欧洲安全规则应由欧洲人主导制定，不可能将俄方排斥在外。欧盟领导人应当真正聆听并认真对待俄方的关切和诉求。

   For example, some articles pointed out that sanctions are not a solution to end the war and build a security order in Europe. To end the war with **reconciliation**, diplomatic methods should be resorted to. Managing relations with Russia, a neighbor of European countries, should be the primary challenge the EU must face **squarely**. When making the security rules of Europe, Europeans should play a central role and Russia cannot possibly be excluded. EU’s leaders should truly **heed** and seriously address Russia’s concerns and appeals.

   > 1. reconciliation
   > 2. squarely
   > 3. heed


   还有的指出，要解决乌克兰问题就必须关注所有相关国家的安全利益。要解决当前的危机，俄罗斯和乌克兰双方都应该从实际出发，重视合理的安全关切。

   Some articles also noted that to resolve the Ukraine issue, the security interests of all relevant countries should be **attended** to. To address the current crisis, both Russia and Ukraine should **bear in mind the realities on the ground** and attach importance to legitimate security concerns.

   > 1. attend


   中方始终主张，对话谈判才是化解危机最现实可行的方式，谋求共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全才可能实现欧洲和世界的长治久安。不断扩大战争、无限升级制裁只会让问题更加复杂，让世界付出更大代价。当前形势下，各方应积极鼓励、支持俄乌谈下去，谈出结果，谈出和平。要摒弃非黑即白的情绪化做法，理性审视乌克兰危机的深层次根源。要避免鱼死网破的极端化做法，为政治解决乌克兰危机创造有利条件。要防止点火浇油的渔利式做法，让国际社会的共同利益战胜个别国家的私利。

   It is China’s consistent belief that dialogue and negotiation is the most realistic and feasible way to **defuse** the crisis, and the pursuit of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can help realize enduring stability and security in Europe and the world **at large**. Expanding the conflict and escalating sanctions **incessantly** will only further complicate the issue and make the whole world **pay a dearer price**. Under the current circumstances, all parties should encourage and support Russia and Ukraine in keeping the talks going to bring about peaceful outcomes. It is important to discard **the binary approach driven by emotions**, and review the underlying cause for the Ukraine crisis with reason. It is crucial to avoid going to extremes where no one will emerge as a winner, and create enabling conditions for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. It is vital to stop profiting from the situation by fanning the flame, and let the common interest of the international community **prevail** over the selfish interests of certain countries.

   > 1. defuse
   > 2. at large
   > 3. incessant
   > 4. prevail


   中方愿同国际社会一道，继续为缓和局势、化解危机、重建和平而努力。

   **China is ready to work with the international community** to **make an effort for** easing the situation, resolving the crisis and rebuilding peace.

2. 塔斯社记者：俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫将于3月31日访华并出席阿富汗邻国外长会。你能否介绍会议日程？访问期间，中俄双方是否将举行双边会晤？
   TASS: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will visit China on March 31 for a meeting of foreign ministers of countries bordering Afghanistan. Can you give us any details on the agenda of the meeting? Will China and Russia hold bilateral meetings during the visit?
   汪文斌：我昨天已经介绍了中方将主办第三次阿富汗邻国外长会的相关消息，没有其他内容需要补充。
   Wang Wenbin: Yesterday, I shared the relevant information on the upcoming third Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan to be hosted by China. I have nothing more to add.

3. 总台央视记者：据了解，第三次阿富汗邻国外长会期间，还将举行阿富汗问题“中美俄+”磋商机制会议。你能否介绍有关情况？中方对会议有何期待？

   CCTV: We learned that the extended meeting of the China-US-Russia consultation mechanism on the Afghan issue will be held on the sidelines of the third Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan. Can you share more information? What expectations do you have for this meeting?

   汪文斌：经各方协商，在3月30日至31日安徽屯溪举行的第三次阿富汗邻国外长会期间，将召开阿富汗问题“中美俄+”磋商机制会议。中国外交部阿富汗事务特使岳晓勇大使将主持会议，美国、俄罗斯、巴基斯坦三国阿富汗问题特别代表将出席。王毅国务委员兼外长将集体会见各方与会代表。

   Wang Wenbin: As agreed upon by all sides, the extended meeting of the China-US-Russia consultation mechanism on the Afghan issue will be held on the sidelines of the third Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan on March 30 and 31 in Tunxi, Anhui Province. Ambassador Yue Xiaoyong, Special Envoy for Afghan Affairs of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will chair the meeting. Special representatives for the Afghan issue of the US, Russia and Pakistan will attend the meeting. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will have a group meeting with the attendees from all parties.


   中美俄巴都是在阿富汗问题上有重要影响的国家。我们期待通过这次会议，与第三次阿邻国外长会形成积极呼应，进一步凝聚各方在阿富汗问题上的共识，推动地区国家和国际社会加大对阿富汗和平重建的支持，帮助阿富汗早日实现和平、稳定与发展。

   China, the US, Russia and Pakistan are countries with important influence on the Afghan issue. We hope to seek synergy between this meeting and the third Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, further build consensus on the Afghan issue, encourage regional countries and the international community to step up support for peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan, and help the country achieve peace, stability and development at an early date.

4. 《澳门月刊》记者：28日，美国国会参院批准“美国竞争法案”替代修正案。该法案针对中国，旨在提升美国在经济、国家安全和外交领域竞争力。中方对此有何评论？

   Macau Monthly: The US Senate passed the America COMPETES Act of 2022 as amended on March 28, which targets China and aims to improve the US competitiveness in the field of economy, national security and foreign affairs. Do you have any comment? 

   汪文斌：中方此前已多次对美国类似涉华法案表明立场。相关法案涉华内容罔顾事实，渲染“中国威胁论”，鼓吹开展对华战略竞争，充斥着冷战零和思维，与中美两国各界希望加强交流合作的普遍愿望背道而驰，中方对此坚决反对，将坚定捍卫自身利益。

   Wang Wenbin: China has made clear its position on similar China-related bills of the US on many occasions. The China-related content of the relevant bill plays up the “China threat” theory and advocates strategic competition with China in disregard of facts. It is entrenched in the Cold-War and zero-sum game mentality and runs counter to the common aspiration of people from all sectors in China and the US to strengthen exchanges and cooperation. China is firmly opposed to this and will firmly defend its own interests. 


   美国怎么发展是美国自己的事。作为世界头号经济体，美方应该做的是维护包括半导体产业在内的全球产业链供应链的稳定，而不是动不动拿中国说事，把中国当“假想敌”。

   How the US develops itself is its own business. As the world’s largest economy, the US should maintain the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, including in the semiconductor industry, rather than pick on China from time to time and see China as an imaginary enemy.

5. 塔斯社记者：据路透社报道，中国外交部本月召见了中石化、中石油、中海油三家国有能源巨头的官员，审查其与俄罗斯合作伙伴的商务关系和当地业务。一名消息人士称，外交部敦促他们不要轻率地购买俄罗斯资产。中方对此有何评论？
   TASS: According to Reuters, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs this month summoned officials from China’s three state energy giants, Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), to review their business ties with Russian partners and local operations. One source of Reuters said the ministry urged them not to make any rash moves buying Russian assets. I wonder if you have any comments on this report?
   汪文斌：我不了解你提到的情况。我愿重申，中俄一贯在相互尊重、平等互利的基础上开展正常的经贸合作。
   Wang Wenbin: I am not aware of the situation you mentioned. I want to reiterate that China and Russia have been conducting normal economic and trade cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefits.

6. 湖北广播电视台记者：据报道，一名中国赴澳大利亚留学生在悉尼国际机场入境时遭澳方无端盘查，后被遣返。发言人能否证实？对此有何评论？
   Hubei Media Group: It is reported that a Chinese student in Australia was interrogated by the Australian side at the Sydney International Airport before being repatriated. Can you confirm this? Do you have any comment on that?
   汪文斌：近期，澳大利亚边境执法人员数次针对中国赴澳留学人员入境悉尼进行无端盘查，检查手机及个人物品，并将中国高校组织军训认定为所谓的“军事训练”，以隐瞒所谓“军事训练”经历为由取消签证并遣返。澳方行为严重损害中国赴澳留学人员的正当合法权益。中国外交部和驻澳使领馆已向澳方提出严正交涉，驻澳使领馆已于第一时间向中国相关留学生提供了领事协助。
   Wang Wenbin: Recently, there are multiple incidents where the Australian border law enforcement officers in Sydney interrogated Chinese students, and examined their cellphones and personal items for no reason when they tried to enter the country to pursue their studies. The Australian side designated the Chinese students’ university military training courses as “military training” and repatriated them after canceling their visas on the grounds that they concealed the experience of “military training”. Such acts have gravely undermined the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese students. China’s Foreign Ministry and diplomatic missions in Australia have lodged solemn representation with the Australian side and our diplomatic missions have provided consular assistance to those Chinese students at the earliest time possible. 

   澳方有关做法与中澳人文交流互利共赢的本质背道而驰。我们敦促澳方停止这种损人不利己的做法，为中澳人文交流与教育合作营造良好氛围，提供必要条件。中方将坚定维护中国赴澳留学人员的正当合法权益。
   What the Australian side has done is at odds with the mutually beneficial and win-win nature of China-Australia people-to-people and cultural exchanges. We urge the Australian side to stop such practice that does no good to others or itself, and create a sound atmosphere and necessary conditions for the bilateral cultural and educational exchanges and cooperation. China will firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students in Australia.

7. 塔斯社记者：周一，五角大楼向国会提交了一份机密的国防战略。根据美国国防部公布的信息，中国被描述为美国“最重要的战略竞争对手”，俄罗斯是“严重威胁”。中方对此有何评论？

   TASS: The Pentagon delivered the classified National Defense Strategy to Congress on Monday. According to a Department of Defense fact sheet about the National Defense Strategy, China is described as the “most consequential strategic competitor” and Russia as an “acute threat”. I wonder if you have any comments on this report?

   汪文斌：美方上述国防战略报告充满冷战和阵营对抗思维。中俄是两个大国，美国企图遏制打压中俄的图谋是不会得逞的。美方应当反思自己在乌克兰危机中应当承担的责任，对制造假想敌、无视他国正当安全关切、挑动集团对抗的做法进行检讨和纠正。我们敦促美方认真落实美国领导人作出的不寻求同中国打“新冷战”、不寻求改变中国体制、不寻求通过强化同盟关系反对中国、不支持“台独”、无意同中国发生冲突等表态，与中方一道努力，找到新形势下中美相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢的正确相处之道。

   Wang Wenbin: The above-mentioned US national defense strategy report is full of Cold War and bloc confrontation mentality. China and Russia are two major countries. The US attempt to contain and suppress them will not succeed. The US should reflect on its due responsibilities in the Ukraine crisis, show repentance for and correct the practice of establishing imaginary enemies, ignoring other countries’ legitimate security concerns and stoking bloc confrontation. We urge the US to earnestly implement its leadership’s statements that the US does not seek a new Cold War with China; that it does not aim to change China’s system; that the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; that it does not support “Taiwan independence”; and that it has no intention to seek a conflict with China. The US should work with China to find the right way to get along with each other under the new circumstances featuring mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.

8. 彭博社记者：美国正在调查一些将成品出口至美国的中国太阳能设备制造商是否通过将零件运往亚洲其他国家进行组装以逃避关税。外交部对此有何评论？
   Bloomberg: The US is launching an investigation into whether Chinese solar-equipment manufacturers are evading tariffs by sending components to other Asian nations for assembly before shipping finished products to the US. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?
   汪文斌：你提到的具体情况我不了解。我想强调的是，美方大搞贸易保护主义，将对国际产业链供应链稳定和全球应对气候变化合作造成干扰和破坏，最后只会反噬自己、损害自身利益。我们敦促美方停止对中国企业的无理打压。中方将采取一切必要措施维护中国企业的正当合法权益。
   Wang Wenbin: I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned. I’d like to stress that the US’ trade protectionism will disrupt and undermine the stability of international industrial and supply chains and cooperation on climate change. Such act is like a boomerang that will harm itself at the end of the day. We urge the US to stop wantonly oppressing Chinese enterprises. China will take all necessary measures to uphold the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.

9. 《环球时报》记者：据报道，台湾方面称，美国国家民主基金会（NED）会长威尔逊于27日至30日率团访台。双方宣布于今年10月在台北举办“世界民主运动”全球大会。发言人对此有何评论？
   Global Times: It is reported that the Taiwanese side said that Damon Wilson, President of the National Endowment for Democracy, is leading a delegation to visit Taiwan from March 27 to 30. The two sides announced that this year’s Global Assembly of the World Movement for Democracy will be held in Taipei in October. Do you have any comment? 
   汪文斌：美国国家民主基金会号称“第二中情局”。这个组织自称“非官方、非营利”，实际上却长期受美国国会和白宫资助，打着所谓“民主”旗号在世界各地从事价值观渗透、颠覆破坏别国政权、煽动反政府运动等不光彩的勾当。近年来，“橙色革命”、“茉莉花革命”、香港修例风波、泰国的反政府示威等多国多地发生的颜色革命、局势动乱和暴力事件的背后都有这个组织的身影。这个组织长期勾连多个国家的反政府团体，实际上是美方干涉别国内政、服务自身私利的工具。
   Wang Wenbin: The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is believed to be a “second CIA”. This self-proclaimed “non-governmental” and “non-profit” organization actually has long been receiving funds from the US Congress and the White House. Under the pretext of so-called “democracy”, the NED is engaged in such shady activities as the infiltration of values, subversion and sabotage of other countries’ regimes, and instigation of anti-government movements around the world. The NED is behind color revolutions, upheavals and violent incidents in many parts of the world, including the “Orange Revolution”, the “Jasmine Revolution”, disturbance over proposed legislative amendments in Hong Kong and the anti-government demonstration in Thailand that happened in recent years. The organization has long colluded with anti-government entities in many countries. It is used by the US as a tool to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs and serve its selfish interests.

   该组织长期同“东突”“港独”“藏独”势力勾连，资助和操控形形色色的反华示威抗议活动，还是诸多涉华谎言谣言的主要制造者和传播者之一。该组织官网的公开数据显示，仅2020年一年，该组织就向近70个涉华项目提供了1000多万美元，用于推动各类危害中国政治社会稳定的活动“落地”。2004年到2020年的十多年间，该组织向各类“东突”组织提供了875.83万美元的资金，是挑动、资助反华分裂活动的“专业户”和“大金主”。
   The NED has long been in league with “East Turkistan”, “Hong Kong independence” and “Tibet independence” forces. It funded and manipulated various anti-China demonstrations and protests, and is a main source and spreader of many China-related lies and rumors. In 2020 alone, the NED provided more than $10 million to nearly 70 China-related projects to promote activities that threatened China’s political and social stability, according to data published on the organization’s website. From 2004 to 2020, the NED provided $8.7583 million in funds to various “East Turkistan” organizations. It is dedicated to inciting and sponsoring anti-China separatist activities. 

   这个组织的负责人现在打着所谓“民主”的幌子前往中国台湾地区，葫芦里卖的，不是民主的良方，而是鼓动分裂的毒药。我们要正告美方，以“民主”为旗号替“台独”势力站台、服务“以台制华”战略的图谋，过去没有得逞，现在和将来更不可能得逞。去年美方举办的所谓“领导人民主峰会”惨淡收场。如果美方还想再借民主之名搞支持“台独”的政治操弄的话，只会遭到更大的失败。
   Now the head of this organization is on a trip to Taiwan under the pretext of democracy. They are not bringing good recipe for democracy to the Taiwan region, but have the poison of separatism up their sleeves. A stern warning to the US side: the attempt to contain China by emboldening the “Taiwan independence” forces in the name of upholding democracy has never succeeded over the years, and will not succeed in the future. The so-called Summit for Democracy hosted by the US last year ended with little support. If the US again tries to seek political manipulation in support of “Taiwan independence” under the pretext of democracy, it will only encounter greater failure.

   我们也要正告民进党当局，“民主”不是“台独”的“挡箭牌”，更成不了“台独”分子的“护身符”。顺应包括台湾同胞在内的14亿中国人民期盼祖国统一的民心民意，这才是真正的民主之道。民进党当局假民主、真谋独的政治操弄只会将台湾民众推向灾难的深渊，必将遭到历史的清算。
   Also a stern warning to the DPP authorities in Taiwan: democracy is not a shield for “Taiwan independence” propositions or elements. True democracy meets the aspiration for the reunification of the nation of the 1.4 billion Chinese people, including our Taiwan compatriots. The DPP authorities’ political manipulation of seeking “Taiwan independence” in the name of democracy will only push the people in Taiwan to the abyss of disasters and they will have to face the reckoning of history.

10. 路透社记者：你能否确认中方是否正式邀请了美国国家运输安全委员会派人来华参与调查航班坠毁事故？如相关人员来华需要隔离，将隔离多少天？
    Reuters: Can you tell us please whether China has sent a formal invitation to the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to join in the investigation for the plane crash? If they want to come, how many days of quarantine if any at all would they have to do?
    汪文斌：我昨天已经回答过这个问题，你可以查阅。
    Wang Wenbin: I have answered this question yesterday. You may refer to that.

11. 彭博社记者：所罗门群岛总理周二表示，中所安全协议的签署已准备就绪，并否认媒体报称所罗门群岛迫于压力允许中国在所建设海军基地。外交部对此有何评论？
    Bloomberg: The Solomon Islands Prime Minister said Tuesday that a security agreement with Beijing was ready for signing. The Prime Minister also denied reports that his country has been pressured to allow a Chinese naval base to be built in the nation. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?
    汪文斌：我们已经多次阐明，中国和所罗门群岛这两个独立的国家开展正常的执法安全合作，符合国际法和国际惯例，有利于所社会稳定和长治久安，也有利于增进地区国家的共同利益，无可指摘。我们希望相关国家切实尊重所方主权，尊重所方自主作出的决定，而不是居高临下地要求所方做什么或不做什么。
    Wang Wenbin: As we said before, normal law enforcement and security cooperation between China and Solomon Islands, two independent countries, is consistent with international law and customary international practice. It is beyond reproach as it is beneficial to social stability and lasting security of Solomon Islands and the common interest of regional countries. We hope relevant countries will earnestly respect Solomon Islands’ sovereignty and its independent decisions instead of deciding what others should and should not do in a condescending manner.

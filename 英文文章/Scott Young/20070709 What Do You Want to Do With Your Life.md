# What Do You Want to Do With Your Life?

https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/07/29/what-do-you-want-to-do-with-your-life/

What do you want to do with your life? It’s a question almost everyone asks themselves. It’s also a question **I don’t believe you should bother asking in the first place.**

*“I don’t know what I want to do in life, all I know is that **it isn’t this**.”*

That was the sentiment a friend reflected to me. She’s in her mid-twenties, smart, **savvy** and hard working. But she is still stuck working jobs that don’t **hover** much beyond minimum wage. Every year, she tells me, that she applies for Universities, but never goes through with it. *Why?* Because she can’t answer that question.

> 2. hover：**VERB**逗留在一处;徘徊;踌躇

## Passion Evolves

I worry a lot of people fall into the same trap. The trap of believing that they need to make big life decisions before they can start doing anything. The trap that you need to be born with a passion. And the lie that being able to combine your interests with a profession is easy.

When people ask me what I’m going to be doing in five or ten years, I usually tell them I’m going to be an entrepreneur. “Oh. What’s your business going to be?” I have reason to believe this internet business could be it. Between revenues and freelance work I’m expecting to make about ten thousand dollars this year. Concentrated effort for the next four or five years could definitely make this a livable income.

But I don’t usually say that. **Because it isn’t the point.** In all honesty, I have no idea where I am going to be in a decade. My track record shows that my passions have evolved considerably, even over the last couple years.

Ben Casnocha, the 19-year old CEO of Comcate, shows how his passion didn’t start with a flash of insight, in the book **[My Start Up Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMy-Start-Up-Life-Learned-Journey%2Fdp%2F0787996130%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1185732377%26sr%3D8-1&tag=scottcom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)**: 

> “It didn’t start with a dream. It didn’t start with in a garage. It didn’t even start with an innovative **epiphany**, which are perhaps entrepreneurs’ most overplayed **recollections**.” He continues, relating the story of Jerry Kaplan’s epiphany moment in Kaplan’s book, *Start Up*. To which Ben adds, **“I wish my epiphany were as primal. It wasn’t, and most aren’t.”** [emphasis mine]

> > 3. primal：**ADJ-GRADED**最初的；原始的；根本的

As Ben shares his story of being a teenage CEO, it becomes clear that his passion evolved. There were interests in entrepreneurship and making a difference. But from these interests, he made smaller steps, each building a passion. I don’t believe his journey ever started with deciding what he wanted to do with his life.

## Replace Decision with Curiosity

**Instead of making definite decisions about a career path, I believe you should get curious.** **Get curious about the way the world works.** Notice your own interests and find small ways you can exercise passion in something. Even if you can’t find a way to make money off of it yet.

The bridge from passion to money-maker can’t be made **hastily**. Interests often get discarded because they cannot be immediately **relayed** into a source of income. And therefore aren’t as important as work that does.

> 1. hasty：**ADJ-GRADED**仓促而就的;匆忙结束的
> 2. relay：**VERB**转播，传送，传输(电视或收音机信号)

Blogging is a great example. I know many bloggers who want to go pro. They want to take the interest they have and turn it into a passionate source of income. But blogging isn’t easy. Even the most rapid successes I’ve seen, took over a year before the author could claim blogging as more than a hobby. And those were due to writing talent, luck and an incredible amount of work.

**Patience is a necessary ingredient in evolving a passion. But even more, you need to be open to other possibilities.**

## Interest to Income Isn’t a Straight Path

80% of new businesses fail in the first five years. But more interesting, is that of the 20% that succeeded, most didn’t do so in the way they had expected to.

Before setting up his immensely popular website, [Steve Pavlina](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/) believed he would make most his revenue through products and workshops. But close to five years later, he makes all of it from advertising and affiliate sales. A revenue prospect he downplayed when making his business plan.

Similarly, I don’t believe that most people’s passions follow a straight path. Scott Adams began with a degree in economics and a position in a bank and now he is the successful cartoonist who created Dilbert.

## Seven Steps to Evolving a Passion… and Making it *Work*

### Step One – Gather Sparks of Curiosity

Don’t have an **inferno** of passion driving your actions yet? Don’t worry about it. Most people I know don’t. And if you are under thirty, you are probably in the overwhelming majority.

> 1. inferno：**N-COUNT**大火灾
>
>    If you refer to a fire as an **inferno**, you mean that it is burning fiercely and causing great destruction.

The first steps is to simply invest your energy into **whims**. Those little sparks of interest where you don’t know enough to make them a passion. Ben Casnocha calls this seeking randomness. For me, it has been a process of finding my intuition and using it to make small investments in things that are potentially interesting.

> 1. whim：**N-VAR**一时的兴致;心血来潮;突发的奇想

This means reading different books, taking on different activities and meeting different people. Broad associations gives a lot of chances to stumble on a passion that can work.

### Step Two: Fan the Flames of Interest

After exposing yourself to a lot of randomness, you need to cultivate the successes. Build upon the little sparks of interest that come by your life. If you read a book about physics and like the subject, try taking a physics class. If you enjoy some basic programming try a small software project.

### Step Three: Cut Out Distractions

**Cultivating whims and exploring new passions requires time. One of the reasons I’ve placed such an emphasis on productivity with myself, is that without it I couldn’t explore these options.**

If your interests are genuine and worth exploring, it shouldn’t be too difficult to eliminate the non-essentials. Distractions such as television, excess internet usage and video games only take a bit of conditioning to free up. The hard part is reallocating time you don’t believe is yours.

### Step Four: Living Minimally

If you already have a job you aren’t passionate about, work only as much as you need to keep going. Valid passions need time to grow into income generating skills.

I don’t suggest becoming a starving artist and **racking up** huge debts. But avoid expanding your life to fit a bigger and bigger paycheck if you aren’t living your passion. Otherwise you simply trap yourself into a life that is comfortable, but otherwise dead.

> 1. rack up：**PHRASAL VERB**（商业上）大量获得（利润），遭受(严重损失)，热销；（体育中）获胜，得（分）

Leo Babauta, author of [ZenHabits](http://www.zenhabits.net) is a great example of this. With six kids, freelancing work and another job to help support his family he found ways to cut expenses and focus on his passion. His website has quickly grown to become incredibly popular, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a stable source of income for him in a few years. Live minimally, and avoid getting trapped into a comfortable, but unsatisfying, life.

### Step Five: Make a Passion that Creates Value

If you have a skill that creates social value, you can make money through almost any medium. Monetizing a passion takes skill, as any entrepreneur can tell you, but without providing legitimate value it is impossible.

**You need to transform your developing passions into a skill that can fill human needs.** Some passions are easy to translate. An interest in computers could allow you to become a software designer. Others are more difficult. A passion for poetry, may be more difficult to meet a specific human need.

### Step Six: Find a Way to Monetize That Value

Once you have the ability to create social value, you need to turn that into a repeatable process for gaining income. This could be in the form of a job. As a programmer you could get hired by Google. Or, it could lead to becoming a freelancer or an entrepreneur.

> Then, is there a list of what is social value?

Monetizing value isn’t easy. It requires that you learn how to market, sell yourself, and find ways to connect human needs. Whether you intend to work in a job or own a business makes no difference. You are the CEO of your life, so you need to know how to connect your passions with serving other people.

### Step Seven: Go Back to Step One

Describing this process in steps is misleading. It implies that there is a destination. There is no destination. The process of following whims, cultivating passions, turning them into valuable skills and then finally earning revenue from them is lifelong. I have some passions that are in steps one and two. This blog is in the midst of step six. In ten years I may have gone through them all with a completely different passion.

Not all your passions will or can finish the sixth step. But as persistent as the myth you need to decide what you want to do with your life, is the myth you can only have one passion. I’m at a point where cultivating passions has meant I have too many options. Too many possible paths that could lead to enjoyable and fulfilling careers. Don’t **obsess** over one failed attempt.

> 1. obsess：**V-ERG**（使）着迷；（使）迷恋；（使）心神不宁
>
>    If something **obsesses** you or if you **obsess about** something, you keep thinking about it and find it difficult to think about anything else.
>
>    其实obsess可以是困扰的意思，因为没有说因为“喜欢”而心神不宁

### What do you want to do with your life?

Your life doesn’t need to go through a predictable story arc. It doesn’t have to start with a dream, follow through hard work and end up in a nice home with four bedrooms. Instead it can twist and travel. You don’t have to know the final answer, you just need to act on the next step.
